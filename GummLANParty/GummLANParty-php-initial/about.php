		In November of 2000, in a conversation on ICQ, niggy mentioned that I should 
		host a LAN Party. After much planning and hoping to get as many people as 
		possible to come, I scheduled it for January 6th, 2001, and made up some paper 
		flyers with instructions to my house.  Using some switches provided to us by an 
		unnamed underground source, we were able to set up enough network ports using two 16-port hubs.
		Of course, none of it would have happened without the help of Bill, ro his organizational skills.
		Many came, and all was well. I, as everyone 
		who was there remembers, was troubleshooting my computer well into the morning, 
		finally giving up to play Rainbow Six at 6AM with the Asians. A Success.

		In April of 2001, LAN Party Number 3 was held. Easily the most unusual LAN 
		Party we've yet to see, the dominant game at this LAN was not Counterstrike. 
		It was not Quake 3. It was not Starcraft, of Diablo 2, or even Unreal. Nope 
		it was TetriNET.... yes TetriNET. The multiplayer Tetris clone, incorporating 
		up to 6 players and special blocks to use as attacks, was played by the majority 
		of the LAN Party attendees for 9 straight hours. NINE STRAIGHT HOURS.

		I my opinion, the best LAN we've had yet. An awesome showing, and a rediculous 
		amount of Quake 3 was played. And the ethusiasm level was extrememly high. 
		The love of Q3CTF4 (the space Capture the flag map) was established here, 
		and when Q3 comes up at recent LANs, it's still the most requested map.

		Held on a Wednesday in August to try to provide a better oppurtunity for those 
		members who work at South Shore Cinema (since it's hard to get off on a weekend 
		at a Movie Theatre), LAN Party 6 was almost a complete flop, and a disgrace 
		to the previously established trend. Few people came, and of those who did, 
		few brought thier computers since "Everyone else will bring one." 
		Needless to say, I was a bit pissed.<br><br>
		The Major redeeming factor of this LAN Party though is the record set by Slaw 
		(aka The Latin Lover): He stayed until 11:30 AM the next moring playing DoD 
		with my little brother.

		In August of 2000, I decided to make a website for the LAN Party.  I went ahead 
		and registerd gummlanparty.net and got to working on it in ASP with an Access Back End.  
		I went around the web searching for a sweet motherboard to use as the theme of the site.
		In short, I find out and very quickly whipped up a nice website.<br><br>
		Meanwhile, I also went around getting the email addresses of everyone I could find, to begin a 
		Newsletter much like <a href="http://home.wi.rr.com/theslaw/">The Slaw</a>, though the purpose of mine is to remind
		everyone of upcoming LAN Parties and new technology like games and sweet video cards.<br><br>
		Soon Enough, I decided that a Forum would be sweet, so I made on in a heirarchial 
		style (like the Battle.net) Forums.  We had a few rather unusual posts, with I feel the funniest 
		thread being the argument between Master Game Master and Network Destroyer.
		<a href="http://www.gummlanparty.net/ShowThread.asp?ThreadID=890"> (Click Here to check it out)</a>
		<br><br>
		That, of course, was all before I even had a login feature, so anyone
could post.  Since then, the website has seen one major makeover, 		and
now as of late, a complete rewrite. 	</td></tr>

		To Get everyone pumped up for LAN 7, I decided to take on a task that everyone always says they will do: Make
		A game map of a familiar place.  I put my sights on one of my two places of business (South Shore Cinema).  As many of the 
		LAN attendees are employees at South Shore, what better an idea then to make a map of it.<br><br>
		Ther Newest game at the time, and the one with the most potential was
Red Faction, of which the premise is that the world is 		completely
destroyable.  After completing several of the theatres, the lobby, the
cafe, and the hallways (and 2 months) I got sick 		of the shortcomings
of the Red Faction Engine and abandoned the project (even to this day,
I don't think I COULD have finished it, simplpy 		because of the
limitationos of the engine (sometimes i would crash, sometimes it
wouldn't even compile the map, the engine just sucked) 	</td></tr>

		LAN 7 was a relativly huge sucess, with the biggest of the news being
the appearance of Soik, our computer teacher from High School, and one
of the many major reasons 		I'm into both programming and Gaming (it
was Soik's "Game Days" held at the school my sophmore through senior
years, on thier super fast 400MHz Dells).<br><br>
		As everyone remembers, I was troubleshooting my computers (yup
"computers" two of my three were having huge problems) all night.  It
wasn't until 2 or 3 AM that I finally 		gave up anbd played on Jackie's
(My girlfriend) computer for the rest of the night<br><br>
		Aside from Soiks awesome appearance and my troubleshooting all night,
we had a lot of fun, and there was a considerably huge turnout. 	</td></tr>

		LAN A (Hex for ten), our most recent LAN Party, was a huge success.  I
had bought 3 more Switches (2 8-ports and 1 16-port), 		and completely
rewired the basement in preparation.  Sadly, we didn't take mny
pictures, but now that I 		have a digital camera, we'll get plenty for
the next LANs.  The Asians played a lot of Warcraft 3, d33t brought his
laptop to serve as a dedicated Q3A Server, and everyone just plain had
fun. <br><br>
		LAN A was also the introduction of the Tournament to the Gumm LAN
Party.  It was a Quake 1 tournament with the idea that everyone would
suck at it cuz it's so bloody old. 		There was no entrance fee, and the
prize was a shitty digital camera I bought on eBay.  Our friend, Fries,
was the ultimate victor (I, however, did not allow myself to be a
		part of the tournament). 	</td></tr>
