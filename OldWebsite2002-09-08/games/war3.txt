Blizzard made a beta of this and gave it to 5000 people.  Nghi was one of them.  He let me borrow it and  I was able to find a Battle.net Emulator.  So Now we can play on the LAN or over the internet without any CD-Key Checks.  I'll be providing an automated procedure to upgrade to.

This game is amazing, even in it's unfinished state.  There are now 4 races: Human, Orc, Night Elves, and Undead.  Each race has three heros, whih are the foundation of any army.  They level up and collect items and are just play strong.  You run around with your units and kill Creeps to level up before battling the enemy.

The gameplay focuses on the battle, rather than the micromanagement and building of a town (though you still need to pay attention to that, just not as much).  The newest version helps you out by telling you that you have idle workers, so you can get them back to work.
