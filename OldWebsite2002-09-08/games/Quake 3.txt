This game has been the dominant force at almost every LAN Party we've had yet.  WHich, of course, is outstanding considering this is still the best 3D game engine around.  With more maps that Unger, Slaw, and I are making, this is sure to continue with it's power.   At least only until Doom3 comes out.
