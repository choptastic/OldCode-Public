Starcraft is one of the greatest games around.  PCGamer rated it the 4th best game of all time in November of 2000.  It's definatly earned it's position there.  It was huge 2 years ago, and it's still pretty much just as strong.  It'se just a shame everyone plays BGH on Battle.net.

I'd like to see some Starcraft being played at LAN Party 7, but if not, no biggy.
