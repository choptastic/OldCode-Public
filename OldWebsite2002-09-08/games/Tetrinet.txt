Everyone Loves Tetris.  There have been a Quadrillion Tetris Clones, but I think that even the original has trouble being cooler that TetriNET.  At LAN PArty 3 (I think it was), we played TetriNET for 9 (that's right - 9) Straight Hours.  Even people that Hate computers (Klamecki), played for a long time.

For Those that are oblivious to what TetriNET is, it's Multiplayer Tetris with Attacks other than the traditional line adding of the opponents when you get a few lines.  There are attacks, defenses, the works.  And it's addictive as hell.  Several years ago, Nghi and I played every night against each other for several hours.
