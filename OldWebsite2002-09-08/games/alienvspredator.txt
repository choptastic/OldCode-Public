This is a great game, however it's difficult to play at the LAN Parties since the copy protection makes it a pain in the ass to copy and redistribute.

Once you get to playing the game, though, it's SOOOOO bad-ass.  Personally I Love hte predator cuz he has such "wonderful toys."  If you hit a human in the head with the speargun, you take his head right off and it sticks to the wall with the spear through it.  He also has his shoulder cannon and his disc.    The Aliens evolve (if you want them to) from the face hugger, all the way to a queen (which is damn bbad ass).  And you get health from biting the heads off dead humans and predators.  Nothing special about the humans as they have the weapons you cna find in pretty much every 3D game.  Except for the flame thrower which burns through aliens like paper.

The preds are slow and damn powerful.  the aliens are fast and can only do hand to hand combat, the humans are right in the middle.
