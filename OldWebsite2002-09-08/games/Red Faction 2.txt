The Sequal to the revolutionary, yet poorly done game, Red Faction.  Many of you remember the South Shore Map I was creating for this game, and abandoned due to a poor engine.  Hopefully this engine will be much better and incorporate much better explosive and lighting techniques.

I was very addicted to RF1 when it first came out (and I spoked everyone), and I hope that RF2 will be enough to keep my attention for longer than a few months.
