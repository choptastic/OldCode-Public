This game is OKAY.  ONLY OKAY.  I know I pumped this game up SOOOO much, then adandoned it with a quickness.  It's an outstanding idea very poorly implemented.  The whole concept is that you can blow holes in walls and manipulate your environment almost infinitly.  The problems arise in it's instability, difficult mapping, almost completly non existant Moddability, and LACK OF DYNAMIC Lights, which to a degree, makes the doom engine even more powerful than the Red Faction Engine.

The only redeeming factor of this game is the South Shore map that was never finsihed.
