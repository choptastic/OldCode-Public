Have some big news for all you hard-corers out there.

***Warcraft 3 Has gone Gold***

Announced today officially on blizzard.com!!!

The Long awaited sequal to the 1995 Game of the Year has finally, almost three years late, Gone Gold.

I can't believe that Blizzard Finally set a Release Date of July 3, 2002.

Read the Press release here:

That means, of course, that there will be a LAN Party on Saturday July 6th Starting at 5PM.


***Working on LAN 9 Stuff***

I'm still working on the Recap Newsletter for LAN 9,  I would have put this in it, but this news is far to important to wait for me until I have a newsletter ready.

Anyone who has pics from the LAN, please send them to me, so I can throw them on the web.

The Awards are almost all hashed out as well.


***New LAN Party***

LAN War3 : Saturday July 6th @ 5PM

Everyone, since this is such short notice, please RSVP so I have an idea of who's comin.  Many of you have already RSVPEd for LAN A, but even if you have, I'll still need you to RSVP for LAN War3.

The focus of this LAN of course is Warcraft III, but I'm sure some quake will sneak it's way in.

"Daboo!!"
