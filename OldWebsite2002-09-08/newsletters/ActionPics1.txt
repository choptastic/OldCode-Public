That's Right . . .

Jeff and I finally played for the first time, the South Shore Map.  This map has 6 theatres currently: 1, 2, 3, 4, 15, & 16.

Needless to say things went well.  He fucked up theatre 15 hard, completely removing the stage and the screen.  He also burrowed deep beneath the slushy machine.  We manged to get toth point where Red Faction cuts off the Ability to creak the walls (its called the Geo-Mod Limit).  We did this without problems.  Check out the pictures on the site.  These pics are good.

Also, to tease Castro (STOP IT! hehe), I've added some pics of the booth.  All it is ais a hallway right now, but I made it to run around in right now.  I'm sure those arethe first pics he'll check out.  So, yes the booth is started.  It'll be relativly easy to finish as well, so I might do that next, right after finishing the other 10 theatres.
