Hey everyone, we certainly had fun at our most recent LAN Party.  There are a few requests, though.  I will need everyone specs on the computers they brought.  Please simply respond to this email with the specs of the computers you brought, since I just forgot to collect that data curing the party.

I'm currently working on the LAN A Recap.  Thanx all for comin.

Additionally, if anyone has any Quake Demos or Screenshots they'd like to send me, go right ahead, you can find them all in Quake/ID1 folder, and they are *.dem files and *.tga files.  Just zip em up and send em my way.  Thanx.

Finally, if you have any Pics from ANY of the LAN Parties, please zip em and send my way.  Thanx.
