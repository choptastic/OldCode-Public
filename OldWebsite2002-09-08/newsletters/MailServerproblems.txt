Hello Y'all,

For those of you that have already recieved these emails, just ignore them.  I was having some problems with my code for my login procedure.  It turns out that I forgot to include a return address in the email and that was causing problems, and it would only send to a few email addresses.  But the problem has been fixed and this time all the web-generated emails will work.

For those of you that registered, but had no confirmation email, I've Activated your login by hand, so you can now log in to the website.

For those of you that have not recieved any of these, please read them and please create an account on the GummLANParty.net website.  Thanx.

Just letting you know that a "Where's Ruf' At?" Section is on the way.  Get ready for some fun.
