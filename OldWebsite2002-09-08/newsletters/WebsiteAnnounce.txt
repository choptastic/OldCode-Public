I'm now officially announcing the Opening of http://www.GummLANParty.net
 
Go check it out as soon as you can, please.
 
Quick overview:
 
Only 4 sections work so far, they are as follows:
Main/News
Games
Computers
Links
 
I'm workin diligently to get the rest up.
 
I'd describe it, but it's pretty self-explanitory.  If you go, you'll get it.
 
Quick reminder: LAN Party 7:
 
Saturday, January 5, 2002 @ 5pm.
