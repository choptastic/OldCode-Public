Hello,

This is just a reminder for those of you that haven't voted for the Date of the next LAN, please do, you only have til Sunday at Night (Sunday Night or early Monday Morning):

These are the days up for grabs:
June 1st, June 8th, June 15th

All are Saturdays and all Start at 5PM.

Also if anyone wants to be a ninja, niggy made a post allowing us to learn the ways of the ancient art, in only a few short minutes.  Do Check it out!

There are also three different stories going, each becoming wierder and wierder.

***Vendors Get the Boot***

The revolution has begun.  South Shore is beginning to weed out the dumb fucks that dominate the vending stand.  We may get a decent vending crew in there again.  Brian Skibinski and Megan have all gotten the boot.  Brian also, according to my sister, recieved a substantial fine for stealing from customers.  Megan has gotten the boot for, as I hear, stealing directly from the registers. . . smart.  Yeah, there's no cameras or anything in the vending stand, unless, of course, if you count the 4 cameras that are in there.


***Andy Becoming a Projectionist???***

WHAT THE FUCK?!?

He's a fucking clown-ass moron.  Leave him dealing with the customers and shit, because we are hired to "put on a show," Marcus hasn't hired us to clean up shit and sell shit, Marcus hired us to "put on a show."  Well, I guess projecting isn't that hard since Michelle is so good at it.  HA!

Not that I am claiming that I am a good projectionist, since I wasn't allowed to finish training because "We didn't need anymore projectionists."  Funny how we haven't lost or gained any projectionists, but all of a sudden we need some.  Hmm...  Andy is the obvious choice.


***Conclusion***

Please vote for the next LAN Date.

Chat rooms will be in the next version of GuLP: v0.4 Beta.
