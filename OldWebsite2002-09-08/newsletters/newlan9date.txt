Voting for Date of LAN 3² is complete.

The results are as follows:

June 1: 0
June 8: 7
June 15: 4

Not too much for voting, I see.

Too bad more people didn't vote, but I guess they didn't care.

So the Date of the next LAN Remains the same (sorry Beth and Adam):

Saturday, June 8th @ 5PM.

How exciting.

Everyone use GuLP, it's the future.

time to study for an exam tomorrow.
