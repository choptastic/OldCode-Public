Word with the South Shore Crew spreads like wildfire, but for those of you that haven't heard, here's a story for you:


***Part 1***

Yesterday was a sobering day for everyone.

As Unger and I were leaving Theatre 10 at South Shore, 20 miles to the northwest, Jackie (my girlfriend) and Nick were pulling out of a parking lot onto Bluemound, pulling over three lanes to make a quick left turn into another parking lot...

I recieved the call roughly 15 minutes later, in my car on the way home from the movie.  It was Jackie's dad on the phone, informing me that my significant other had been in a car accident and is at Oakbrook Memorial Hospital.  Rather confused, as I (well no one) wasn't used to recieving calls of that nature, I said I'd be there as quickly as possible.

When I got there, I got my first glimpse of her.  It was relieving to see her alive and awake.  It was not relieving to see her shirt soaked in blood and among other smaller cuts, a gaping gash on her left cheek, obviously from shattered glass.  Nonetheless, it was good to see her doing well, all things considered.  I gave her a kiss, handed here a dozen roses, and greeted her and her family.

Nick was on the adjacent bed, sitting upright, and appearing to be in fine shape.  I walked over to him, and punched him in the face...hehe, just kidding...sorry I know this a serious story, but I had to take it....I shook his had and greeted him.  He was fine, except for his elbow, which he had somehow hurt.

THe Cop had said that if the truck had hit her any further up the car, that she probably would be dead...Thank goodness for that.  

We sat there, waiting for the doc, and discussed how it happened and other various things.

The Cop said that he was sorry, but he had to leave because a fight had just broken out.

After a half-hour or so, the doc finally emerged.  He was actually a plastic surgeon, brought in because the normal doctor didn't want to have to fix the huge cut on her cheek, and felt that a plastic surgeon would definatly be a better choice.  FYI, the cut was about 2 inches long, and about a quarter inch wide, and very deep (I, actually, am surprised the cut didn't go all the way through the cheek).  A Very nice guy, the doc was.

Jackie's mother stayed with the doc and Jackie while she was being sewn.  I would have liked to stay (both for support and to watch), but the doc only allowed 1 other person.

Nick's parents arrived to pick him up and were asking about the situation.  He explained as best he could (No one really remembers what happened).

When the doc was finished fixing Jackie, we finally saw her. She was much better now, some of the blood had been cleaned off her face, and her cuts were all patched up, and covered by a protective tape of some sort.  Apparently the doc had used 70+ stitches, even he lost count.

She will need to go back on Friday and again on Tuesday.


***Part 2***

...Jackie and Nick were going from one store to another...across Bluemound Road in Brookfield, where according to the cop, there are on average 3 accidents a day.

They had crossed 3 lanes of traffic to a turnaround (or whatever it's called).  There was a car there already, waiting to turn around or pull into the same parking lot Jackie was intending on entering.  Apparently she hadn't pulled in far enough, and the back of her car was protruding into the left lane partially.  Normally, when someone sees that, they slow down.  Not the driver of the fullsized F150 Pickup Truck that plowed into Jackie and her little Toyota Corolla, sending them for a spin and causing Jackie's face to smash her driver's side window, which is now gone.

As Jackie was just regaining her breath (she had had the wind knocked out of her), the driver walked over to Jackie, not to ask if she was okay, which she obviously wasn't, as blood was rushing down her face, but rather to make the comment: "Just couldn't wait, could ya?"  She just looked at him with the eye that wasn't blinded by blood.

To make things worse, the cop determined the fault lie in Jackie, not in the asshole.

As she laid there waiting for the meds, Nick called her parents, who in turn called me. Some good sumaritans came to the temporary rescue to provide some napkins to at least slow the bleeding.   Jackie really didn't know what was going on, and he remember very little from the incident.  Neither she, nor Nick saw the Truck comin.  When the meds asrrived, Both she and Nick were finally placed in ambulances, and rushed to the hospital.

***Part 3***

When we finally got home that night, around 10:30, Jackie and I ate, as She hadn't eaten since lunch, and I (as usual) hadn't eaten all day.  So I went and got us some Arby's since it was late and it was either that, Taco Bell, or McDonalds.

Jackie took her medicine and I tucked her into bed, and went home, to email my boss and let him know I was taking the day off tomorrow.

Nick had called Mike and Jessie that night, and they got Doughty to work for Jackie Tuesday night.

The next day, Jackie woke around 8:30 to take her meds, and called Amy to cancel their date that day.  Amy, in turn, called Bill.  Bill called me, just as I was waking up (around 10:30) to ask how Jackie was doing.  Shortly thereafter, Unger called, I'm assuming he had heard from my boss, to give his condolences.  I checked my email, and my Boss had also given his best, on behalf of the Cayen & Associates Staff.

I was at her house at around 11:30 am, and I laid with her for a few minutes before we got up and she got cleaned up...which was a considerably difficult process, as she was not allowed to get the stitches wet.  Meanwhile I set up her DVD player in her room, prepared for an exciting day of X-Files and Movie Watching.

At 1ish, I called Castro, to ask for him to work for Jackie on Friday morning.  He said he'd work any shift for her she'll need, which is very nice of him.

At 1:30 or so, the doorbell rang. It was flowers, both from The Schroepfer family (Aunt Terri, Uncle Mike, Beth, and Adam) and from Mike and Jessie.  Jackie loved them, and Jackie's mom was getting misty, which set off Jackie as well.

Nick came over shortly thereafter, with some gifts.  Some candy(I believe) and a poster of Audrey Hepburn, whom Jackie really likes.  The three of us watched the beginning of Fletch.

Bill and Amy came over at roughly 2:30 and had flowers both from themselves and Castro.

The doorbell rang again.  This time it was flowers from my parents.

That night we finished watching Fletch, and I tucked her in and came home, and told her story, which brings me here.


***Conclusion***

I wrote this so everyone knows what happened, and so there is no confusion.  And to tell a good, although sad, but optimistic story.

Jackie has been very brave throughout this experience, which she has described as the scariest moment in her life.  Thank you everyone that gave gifts and your condolenses...this is from me...Jackie will thank you all in her own, more personal, way.  Your kindness and love are appreciated.

Jackie, we are all happy to see you doing as well as you are.

I Love You, Jackie.
