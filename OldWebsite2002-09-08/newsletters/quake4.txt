Reading through the newsest edition of PCGamer, I just happened across a little snippet mentioning Quake 4.

I must say, I almost simultaneously wetted and soiled my pants.  Here's exactly what was said:

Quake IV
What we know : Raven's sequel to the best-known FPS franchise on the planet will user the Doom III engine...and that's about all we know (though a strong single-player game is promised).
Reason they won't talk : Don't expect to hear much about Quake IV until Doom III has it's day.  Raven can't spill the beans on the engine before id does.

Amazing that wisconsin based, Raven Software (Jedi Knight II and Soldier of Fortune 2, both Quake 3 Engine games), will be creating the next edition in the series that has defined my personal being, Quake.  I'm in tears (because I hafta poop somethin fierce).

John Carmack had a preview of Doom III at QuakeCon 2002, to read some information on that follow this link:

Having played the XBox only once in my life (courtesy of Adam Schroepfer), and that one game being Halo, I was very impressed withthe game, although I still dislike the idea of a joystick based game.

Luckily, Halo is being ported to the PC (it's only natural to port it to PC as the XBox is really just a specialized PC).

Happy I am....

More information whne I get it.
