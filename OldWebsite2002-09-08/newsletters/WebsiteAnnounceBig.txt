Goddamn it's late, I need to get to bed.
 
So here's the scoop on website.
 
I'm sure most of you have yet to see the website.  Well if you want to see it sometime soon, now is the time.
 
Feel free to join in the message board conversations.  They are pretty twisted.  Slaw, we'd like your input at the messge board.
 
I've added an option to vote for your favorite game, and yes, you can stil suggest your own game.
 
Also, if you've been to the site recently, you surely noticed the RSVP section and how it requires a password.  Well, I am now formally inviting you to register for the Nest LAN Party.  Pleas enter your name, email address, the number of fast and slow computers you plan to bring.
 
THE PASSWORD TO RSVP IS: [not displayed publicly]
 
PLEASE RSVP.  I need to know how many people are planning on coming so I can plan the floor layout of my basement.  Remember that I don't have a hole ton of space to put people and computers, I'll need my estimate to be as precise as possible.
 
 
 
Additionally, Tell your friends to Add themselves to my contact list, they can do so by Going to the contact List section and Adding themselves.  There is a "Reference Code" to get someone added automatically to the list, rather than having me contact them and find out who they are.  To do this, they will need to provide the "Reference Code."

I still need a few email addresses.  They are as follows:
 
Kevin Boisits
Mike Nelson
Jake Maass
Jenny Scheiding
Josh Rothman (Homer)
Matt and Jason De Witt
Melissa Graffenius
Tony Do
