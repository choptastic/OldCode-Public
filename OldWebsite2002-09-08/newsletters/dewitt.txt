Well, my friends, Matt Dewitt leaves for the marines in the next few days.  I'll miss ya brutha, have fun in Japan or wherever you are going to go.  It's sad that you gotta leave, but at least you'll come back all ripped and shit, and able to kill us if you so wished.  It is imperative that you tell me what your email address will be in the marines.  Send me an email or a snail mail:

So On to the LAN Party related stuff.  I've finished theatres 8 - 10 on the South Shore map.  I'll hafta make them a littel thinner though cuz I have them waaay too wide.  They are all wide like theatre 5.  So I'll just hafta make a few changes.
 
Additionally, LAN 7 is RAPIDLY approaching.  Only a month and 1 day to go.  That's Nuts.  I'm beginning to get nervous, which is a good thing since I haven't been nervoud about a LAN since the first one I hosted.  I'd like to remind everyone to please RSVP.   And the password is : [edited]
 
I've just ordered two more 100 Mb switches, so I'll only need 1 more I think, and We'll be good to go.  Also, I've written a little program that will count the number of computers on the LAN.  This info will become live on the web updated every 5 minutes starting a week before the party.  Additionally, wiring of the basement to prepare so you'll just hafta sit down and plug in and you'll be ready has begun.I'll hafta raid South Shore and my Grandma's house to get some Tables and Chairs.  I will die if we don't have enough room, but we may ery well run out, so I STRONGLY ADVISE that if you are bringing a computer, come early, or reserve your spot by bringing it over the night before.
 
K that's it... Check out the Pics and RSVP!!
