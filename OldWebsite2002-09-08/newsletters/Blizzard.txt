Hello fellow LANers,

I'm pulling a Blizzard with the South Shore Red Faction Map.  The official release date has been moved to Friday, December 21st.  After a two week break from it after the INCREDIBLY tedious task of the vending stand and Cafe, I'm now tackling the less difficult task of the theatres.  There will be lots of Cut and Past here, so I'm excited.  Maybe if I'm lucky I can make the opriginal deadline, but I doubt it.

Plus those of you (and I know there are enough of you) that haven't seen the Gumm Mullet Pics, please, expose yourself to thier awesome beauty.  The mullet will one day rule the world.

[Edited out for reasons undisclosed] I figure we could play sdome DoD since Slaw's so goddamn gungho on it.  I'll give it a shot.

Also remember Tetrinet will be there in Mass Quantities, I still have 3 slow computers I haven't set up yet, but I will for Tetrinet.

I'm also intersted to know if anyone will have an XBox or Gamecube by then, please let me know if you plan on getting them and whether or not you are able to bring it.

Also, please RSVP if you haven't, yet.  I've added a list of those who've RSVPed so far.  Please do so.  The password to RSVP is: [Edited]

And as a reminder if you have any friends you'd like to add to the contact list, the password for instant addition is: [Edited]
