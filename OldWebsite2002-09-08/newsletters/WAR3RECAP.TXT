Well we had a lot of un playing Warcraft 3 at the moist recent LAN Party.  Sadly there are no pictures, but I can at least describe it.

***No Setup***

Contrary to the other, bigger LANs, I did not do much for set up.  Normall I take a day off for setup, but this time I was working like a fiend, so there was no time for setup on Friday.  I did all the set up on Saturday when I woke up at noonish.  Since this was projected at being a smaller one, I felt that was acceptable, it was slightly bigger than I was expecting, however.


***Two Distrinct Groups***

Also contrary to the usual LAN Party, where the vast majority of the attendees are or were South Shore employees, this party, with the exception of Evan Kopperud for 2-3 hours and Bill and Amy for 10 minutes,, was made up entirely of Younguns (highschoolers) and Asians.  And of course, Foo Yang was a combination of both.


***The Game***

Many of you are wondering if you should go out and get Warcraft 3.  I strongly advise it.  The game is spectacular.   The gameplay is great, The concept is genius, the graphics are amazing, and the execution makes it one of the best games ever.  The Single play campaign has n outstanding story.  I don't pklay single player campaigns but I am playing the War3 Campaign.  I Strongly advise the purchase of the $60 game, and if you are willing to drop $80, the collector's edition comes with 4 "limited edition" prints, a DVD of ingame cinematics for all three warcraft games, the soundtrack, a collector's edition manual, and it all comes in a sweet hard plastic box.


***Surprise***

Historically, Any and Every RTS Game has been dominated by our Asians friends Nghi and Bee.  They have the dedication to be the game, and they just have the minds for it.  Here's an example of the true RTS Power that is the asians : I've played maybe a hundred games of Warcraft 2 and Starcraft wityh Nghi, yet I've only beaten Nghi one in each.  The one time I beat him in Warcraft 2, he had a terrible starting position located a consiterable distance from the nearest gold mine.  In Starcraft, I only beat him because the game was only a few days old, and neither of us had the strategy for it.  Additionally, Nghi and Bee learned how to play Red Alert 2 in like 2 weeks enough to beat out Unger and Goelz.  So that just says something.

But we were all in for a rude awakening.  Sure we were playing the game and Alex Beckett and Ben Trapp were whuppings us, but the Asians were not here yet.  We figured "when they get here it's all over."  We were wrong, despite the fact that Nghi had had the Beta.  I, honestly, thought that Nghi and I would have the far superior upper hand since Nghi let me borrow the Beta, and I musta gotten a good 40-50 games in on that.

"Oh Man I was WAAAY Off"

Alex and Ben totally dominated the playing field.  Which ever team they were on was guaranteed victory.  It was incredible.  Alex had somehowe gotten his hands on a pirated FULL VERION a FULL MONTH before it came out.  How?!?!? I have no idea, but he had been playing against the computer for over a month now, and his skills were very honed.  So we were so done.


***Highlights***

We probably got in a total of 8 games.  One was a 7 man Free For All, that My brother kept telling everyone where he was and he wanted someone to kill him, but he didn't just want to quit.  Funny that he happened to be the last one alive (aside from Alex killing his army).  We also had a HUGE 5v5 Where who was the first to go?!?! ME!!!  Goddammit!!  But it was sweet nonetheless.  The Party lasted until around 5:30 AM.  We also played a little Jedi-Knight 2, and Jeff and his friends constantly played Counterstrike.


***Awards***

I'm don't have the statistics ready yet, but Here are the awards.  I'm also narrowing down the awards a bit, since much hasn't changed since last LAN.

Best Setup - Nghi with his KT333 Chipset board, his XP 1800+, and his DDR Ram.  Throw in a Radeon 8500LE with 128MB of DDR, and you have one bad ass System.  Anmd his 19inch monitor certainly enhanced it a bit.

Bad ass Warcraft 3 Players - Alex Beckett and Ben Trap for smoking us all up.  Just give the asians a few weeks on Battle.net and they'll rewin their crown back.

Been to every LAN Party - just kiddin, This one doesn't count...hehe

Troubleshooting - Although Leng wasn't even playing on his computer, his computer was out of commission the whole time, while after two formats tried to put the network card in another slot, and it worked.


***Workin like a fiend***

This most recent two week payperiod, I put in 140 hours.  That'll be a sweet paycheck.  Time and a half rules.  Additionally, I'm going up north this week, and to continue working, I'm taking my server and the company Laptop.  So I'm sorry that the website will be down for a week.

Again... THE WEBSITE WILL BE DOWN FOR A WEEKUI IT'LL BE BACK UP ON THE 22ND OF JULY FOR SURE!!

I expect all you foos out there to jump right on it that day and post liked fiends.


***Poop-phelia***

You may have heard of Matrox's New Card, the Perphelia.  Three monitors, 256 DDR Ram, ad 512 Bit GPU.  John Carmack, whom you should all kno0w as the genius behind Wolf3d, Doom, and Quake, and the upcoming Doom 3, has put out a statement saying that the Parphelia essential.ly runs like crap in Doom 3.  So if any of you were considering dropping the $400 or $500 on the sweet triple monitor,r full-180 degree vision Video Card, Don't...that is, if you want to play D3 decently.


***Mike the Bartender***

Our good friend Mike Sorrell recently attended the Bartending School.  You know that commertial 1-1800-Bartend.  That's it.  For something like $400 Mike should be a bartender now, though I don't know if he's taken the final exam, yet.  It's the same school where Thomas Maphother IV, also known as Tom Cruise, learned to flip atround bottles for Cocktail.  They have a 100% Graduation rate and guarantee a job bartenduing when you get out.  So if you need a job that pays decently, and your over 18, which most of you are, go for it.


***Iklektik***

I recently attended what I think is my first little gig-type performance of a local band.  This particular local band has a member in it who just happens to be Jackie's Brother-in-Law (Sister's Husband), Jimmy Briggs.  I must say I was impressed with the band, in addition to having some batchy tunes, they certainly know how to put on a show.  THe Premise of one song, if I remember correctly was "Havce you ever dated someone who was so crazy that you were sure they were on drugs?  That's what this song is about"  Hysterical!!

A rather surprising thing was to see Brian Hibbel, Jake the guitar player, and Eric, whose name I don't remember, playign there.  They were the third banmd and they were good too.

Overall, it was fun, but it was a bit too loud...as many of you know being into classical, I listen to rather quiet music. I'd certainly like to see Iklektic again in a somewhat quieter environment, but I guess that loses the effect.

Many of you reemmber the time when I actually threw up because of the UW band playing so bloody loud in the gym.  That was sweet.


***Raven Shield***

Tom Clancy is putting out another game.  When ,i don't know, but Rainbow Six : Raven Shield has begun development.  I'm extatic already.


***Medieval : Total War***

The sequal to Shogun : Total War is getting close to completion.  The whole premise of the game is a huge number of troops on the battlefield at the same time, going at it.  You can have armies of like 15,000 troop all Fighting.  Very impressive.  Im interested in this, and might buy it if the demo is good enough.

***Conclusion***

LAN A : Friday August 23rd, or Saturday August 24th.  I'll have the survey ready when I get back.

Okay I'm done, I hafta pack.
