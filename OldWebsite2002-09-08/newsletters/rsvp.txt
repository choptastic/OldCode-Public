Hello everyone on the Gumm LAN Party Mailing List.

Just a friendly reminder to RSVP on the website.  If you are not sure what you can bring, just estimate, I can always change it later if you need.

Additionally, as an added attraction, I've created a Survey of the Week.  This week's topic is which word for "hate" has more impact?  This is based on a rather meaningless conversation held between Justin, Jackie, Nick, and myself a few months ago.

Feel Free to suggest Survey Topics on the messageboard.

I'm also currently working on a Red Faction Map of South Shore Cinema.  I'm sure anyone that currently works there or did work there would appreciate blowing that fucker up using Red Faction's Ultra Cool Geo-Mod Technology where you can blow up pretty much anything in the environment.

So Please, RSVP!!!!  I really need to know how many computers and how many people are going to be there, so I can plan ahead.  I know if seems like "But it's so long away, I'll just wait."  That mentality won't work.  I will be buying supplies slowly over the next few months, so I need to know how many tables/switches/hubs/chairs/munchies/etc I'm going to need.  So Please, RSVP!

Auf Wiedersehen
