Yo,

It's been a few weeks since the last newsletter, so I figured it's time for another one.  School has kept me from doing this for the past weeks because school is gay and I don't have all easy business classes.  Instead I have classes like "Intro to the Theory of Computation" and "Data Structures and Algorithms."  I don't, one the other hand, have classes like "Excel 101" and "Marketing Cigarettes to Minors."

New Joke (I thought this one up myself after waking up in one of my classes):

Q:	Why are math and computer science liberal (politically) majors?
A:	Al-Gore-ithms

hehe.  Puns are great.


***Good News***

No not the Bible.  Memory prices are cheaper.  Being a dork, I check Crucial.com for memory prices at least once a week.  Well, last weak a 256MB unbuffered DDR DIMM was $96.  Monday they had dropped down to $69 (a huge drop).  And I just checked 30 seconds ago, and the same stick is now  $85.    I don't know if you could say prices are "on the fall," so to speak, but they are a little bit cheaper.


***Warcraft 3***

I've finally seen my first game of Warcraft 3.  I witness Nghi play a game as the Night Elves.   He won-Go figure.  Damn cool game.  

Blizzard also did and April's fools joke, in which it announced it was throwing another race into the fray, the Pandaren Empire (a Race of Pandas...hehe).  Here's the link to the page:  http://www.battle.net/war3/pandaren/


***More Cops***

Yup, you guessed it,  I got pulled over again.  This time to making a left turn where I guess there was a no left turns sign.  I didn't see the sign, so I wasn't intentionally breaking the rules.  But the cop just gave me a ticket for not wearing my seat belt.  He had said that "My record is good from '99, so I'm gonna let you off."  Many of you will say, "How can that be, you've been pulled over close to 20 times and have had 6 tickets, how can your record be 'good'"  The answer, my dear friends, lies in the fact that I haven't actually been convicted of a traffic violation since the end of '99 . . . All the others have just gone away.


***Hatred***

This is not going to sound like my style at first.  I was walking to school (UWM-Univ of WI MyNuts), just chillin, kinda listening to the birds and thinking, "this tranquility is pretty sweet."  Until a fucking van drove by blasting rap, the bass shaking the whole of the van, and it's surrounding cars.  My transquility had been broken.  Then I finally realized, "I hate the world we live in!"  Manyof you know my plan is to make Milwaukee a good city again, by starting a company that gets big, and is headquartered in Milwaukee.  But, that idea is gone.  I don't care about Milwaukee, or anywhere else for that matter.  I, personally, would have ENJOYED feeding that fucking thugs brain to him, Hannibal style.

I will restate, "I hate the world we live in."  People have no respect for anyone else.  I don't care if you chose to listen to shit like rap, but listen to it yourself.  Don't force everyone within a mile to listen to it.  Why should I care about people that have no respect for anyone?  It's not logical, so I don't.

A Cell phone just went off, playing "Fur Elise," by Beethoven.  How many people that use that ring for thier phone even know the name of the composer of that piece?  I'll be not many.  Save the good fucking rings for the people that know and respect the music of that master.  I'll bet half of them have never even heard the Real Piano version of it, but they all say "Classical music is gay." Yet they use it on thier phone.

The moral of the story is this:  Respect people, TURN DOWN YOUR GODDAMNED, FUCKING, WASTE OF MONEY "SYSTEM"!!!!  It's things like that that make me want to kill people in gruesome ways.  And I do want to kill people. . . but I am sadly held back by those silly laws(we are overpopulated, I think we can afford to kill the useless, more food for everyone else).


***LAN Party 3² update***

The date for LAN Party has come under some heat, and so I'll be making a voting feature to vote for the date of the next LAN Party.  The issue is June 8 is the first saturday after graduation, therefore, I will be conflicting with many a Graduation party, or the Graduation ceremony itself.  The options will be June 8, June 15, or June 22.  The survey functionality has not been implemented yet, but you can expect it within a week.  Registering will be a requirement of voting, and every registrant well be allowed to vote only once.

So Think about what day you would like for a LAN and be prepared to vote.  Even if you don't want the day to change, then vote for June 8.

***Conclusion***

Sorry about the rant.  I'm not going to kill anyone, but things piss me off to degrees where I think I'm going to explode.  My hatred of the ghetto grows daily and eventually I'm just going to "set the building on fire."

So Far LAN 3² is: Saturday June 8, 2002, but it may be changing.

Auf Wiedersehen
