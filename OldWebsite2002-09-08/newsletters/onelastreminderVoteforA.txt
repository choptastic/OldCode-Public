***Vote for LAN A***

I said I would close voting tonight, but since I have a grand total of 14 votes so far... our of 45 registrants, I think a few more really should vote.

So I will be closing the voting on Friday... this Friday... Vote, for the date,

The Dates up for options are as follows.

Friday August 23rd, or Saturday August 24th.

So Vote Please!!!
