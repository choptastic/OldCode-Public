***Trapped in a Blizzard***

Blizzard has once again topped itself.  This time Warcraft III has beaten out Diablo II for the fastest selling PC Game of all time.  As of July 22nd, Warcraft III has sold over 1 Million Copies Already.  In addition to that, Warcraft III is also the 7th game in Blizzard's repetiore to sell over 1 Million copies.  True, id is damn powerful, and John Carmack is Damn smart, but Blizzard knows how to make Games.  id, however cool they are, know how to make Engines.


***The Conversation***

I was sitting at Denny's alone and crying one night, when I overheard this conversation.

Midget: "An official Gumm LAN Party Tourney?"
Mullet: "Yup!!"
Midget: "When?"
Mullet: "At the next LAN Party...LAN Party A"
Midget: "What's the Game?"
Mullet: "Not sure, hasn't been announced yet, but I think he's leaning toward Quake 1, but he's open to suggestions."
Midget: "Damn!! Quake 1?!?!  That game like 7 years old!!"
Mullet: "Yeah I think that's why he's leanin that way, cuz no one will be good at it, even him."
Midget: "So... uhh... what's the prize gonna be?!?"
Mullet: "I heard something about a Digital Camera"
Midget: "A Digital Camera, Holy Shitstained Zubaz, how can he afford that?!?!"
Mullet: "I don't know, but somehow he managed to."
Zubaz : "Did I hear someone call me?!?!"
Mullet: "Yeah, I was just telling Midget About the first official Gumm LAN Party Tourney, where the prize is a digital camera"
Zubaz : "Damn Nigga!! That's pretty cool, but not nearly as cool as a Dale Earnhart Shirt."
Midget: "I hear ya, Zubaz"
Mullet: "Yeah he is my god"
Zubaz : "Well he WAS my god, but now that Jeff Gordon fella, man he is one HOT MOFO!!"
Midget: "Yeah I'd love to get together with him and BeetleJuice the Black Midget Porn Star....goddamn he is sexy"


***The New Soik***

On July 21st, a new breed of programmer was born.  Tracy Soik gave birth to Maggie Elaine Soik, who was 9 lbs.  John Carmack, look out.  Soik has informed me that he has already been teaching the youngun bits and bytes, and soon she'll be on powers of 2.  Congrats Soik.

Have a look-see.  She's a cute kid.  Here's a picture of father and daughter:

***Antique Rocket Launcher***

Many of you know that when I played Quake Seriously, I played it damned seriously.  From Sophmore Year to Early Senior Year, I played Quake 1 daily...almost religously.  Many of you have heard of clan PiaS, which stands for "Poop in a Shoe."

I started PiaS essentially, because when I first started playing Quake, I wanted to get in one of two clans, neither of which I w3as good enough to get into, so I started my own clan: Poop in a Shoe.  This clan was created for the less fortunate...the "special olympics of Quake", if you will.  However, as time passed, I started getting good, as did the rest of the clan.

All of a sudden, We were able to put up a decent fight against those in the clans I wanted to get into.  So my 4 hours a days for two years payed off, and I was a formidable opponent in Quake 1.  Life was good.

Well time moved on, and computers and internet got faster, and my internet got slower.  Eventually, I stopped playing Games altogether.  My pentium 100 was just too damn slow for me.

Now it's several years later, and I think I can consider myself at least a half-time hardcore gamer.

So I was feeling a litte nostalgic a few days ago, and I decided to install Quake 1 and play online.

I had totally forgotten how fast paced that game was...It's crazy fast.  I Suck hard core at Quake 1 now.

***ATi a contender?***

Whodda thought that ATi Would put out a good card that would not only have good drivers, but would also smoke the shit out of vNidia?  I certainly wouldn't.  Well they have (or rather are going to).  The ATi Radeon 9700 is approaching it's release date, and even with preliminary testing, it beats the GeForce 4 Ti4600 in almost every aspect.  It even doubles it's preformance sometimes.  The first run of these cards will be released with 128MB RAM, but the next run will have 256MB.  nVidia's newest card won't be out for a few months, so ATi will be the top of the market for a few months, for the first time in 5 years.  Good Job ATi, maybe I'll splurge and get the new $400 video card.... but probably not, I'm looking at a Ti4200.

***Official Language***

Correct me if I'm wrong, But I believe that Brown County has just passed legislation setting an Official Language for the county.  That language, if course, being English.  I hope this starts a trend, and eventually we set a National Language.


***The Snake of Death***

We were all out on the lake, wrestling on the floaty platform thingy, when my mom yelled, "Randy get over here!"  He yelled back "What's the problem?"  And she replied wih "There's a big snake over here."

I, upon hearing that, immediatly dove into the water and swam to shore to check it out.  I looked into our little cellar-like thing we call a basement, and sure enough there was a Yellow Snake with Large Black spots crawling into a hole in the wall, between two rocks.  Not sure where it was headed, and having heard of an escaped pet snake that was eating surrounding wildlife, I didn't know what to do.  So I grabbed it's tail and threw it outside of our "basement."  I was already very shakey as I've never handled a snake larger than a garter snake, and I picked up an axe and began my confirmations: 

"What do you want me to do?!?!  You want me to kill it?!?!  I want to keep it!  I'll feed it mice and stuff, it'll be sweet."
"Kill it"
"Do you want me to kill it?!?!"
"Kill it" said another
"Do you want me to kill it, this is the final confirmation?!"
"Yeah, Kill it"

So I took the axe and but it in half, then I cut its head off, since it was still wriggling, and I wanted to put it out of it's misery.  It's little head was still wriggling, so I smashed it with a claw hammer, to really put it out of it's misery.

I wish I would have been able to keep it.

It turned out to be a Pine Snake, somewhat common around the area (although in my 21 yeard of going up there, I've never even SEEN a wild snake up there)


***Pinochle is gay***

I've never played Pinochle.  But over vacation, I wanted to get 4 decks of cards for dealing blackjack to my siblings and thier friends, and with 1 deck, I was shuffling almost every hand.  So I needed more cards.  But being in the middle of nowhere certainly doesn't help when you want something.  The only sure thing was the hardware store had a toy isle.  So we went there to get some cards. They didn't have any plain Poker Cards, so I picked up 4 decks of "Pinochle" Cards, and we went to the cashier, and asked her what the difference is between Pinochle cards and Poker Cards.  She, of course, didn't know.  So one of the other employees opened a box and flipped through them and concluded "They're just normal cards."

So I bought them and went back to our cottage to open them.

Once we opened them, lo and behold, we noticed that the deck had no cards 2 through 8.  Outstanding.

My question is this: How do you not notice that the deck only contains 9,10,J,Q,K,A and not notice that there aren't any small cards.

Dumb shits.


***Technology Paradox***

Recently, I made an unusual observation about computer nerds, such as myself.  Take note:

Computer Nerds are lazy, programmers especially.  They are so lazy in fact that they are willing to work 80 hours a week just to make life easier and essentially be lazier.  I know that's true of me.


***Gambling is fun***

Saturday July 20th, Jackie and I wanted to go to a Casino and Play some bingo.  We figured we'd bring my parents along and we'd play some bingo, then I would go play some Blackjack.

So Saturday, I called the nearest casino (10 miles away, remember I'm up north), and they didn't have any bingo on a Saturday night.  Wouldn't you think that Saturday night would be a kickin time for ANYTHING?... Guess not.  So to try and find a casino playing bingo that night I called all over the place.  I made a phone call to every casino within 40 miles (and there were quite a few of them), and I even called Oneida in Greenbay, 70 miles away, but on the way home.

Oneida was the only one that had bingo Saturday night.

Then I got a wild idea....Jackie had recently gotten into Blackjack, playing a computer blackjack at home.  And I thought I recall the Gambling age in Michigan being 18....  Hmm.... So I found the nearest casino in Michigan (I'm using Yahoo Yellow Pages for this and it's soooooo bloody slow,  although I didn't knwo what my connection speed was, I'm almost positive it was under 19200, probably closer to 9600), and although they didn't have Bingo at night, they did have a Gambling Age of 18.

So I asked Jackie what she wanted to do, and she was all about going to Michigan.

We packed up our stuff, let my parents know what we're doing, and took off for the U.P..  The Road there was terrible, 3 to 5 miles of it was loose gravel, and I have one of the least all-terrain vehicles around.  My car was shaking violently, even at less than 20 MPH.  Needless to say, I was clenching the Wheel for fear of my life.

When that ended, then we passed through "Ghost land."  This area was damn creepy.  There was fog only near the ground and it came up from the ground in wisps, almost like long thick fingers.  Out of the corner of your eye, many of them looked like people.  Very creepy.  I was just waiting for something like a Giant Moth to come at me real fast (Mothman prophecies reference).  It was pretty sweet.

The rest of the trip was rather uneventful, aside from how bloody long it took.

When we got there, we noticed the clock said 1AM, we left at 9:30 PM...It couldn't have taken that long.  Well as it turns out, we were about 1 mile easy of the Time-Zone Border. WE were Like 5 miles from Escanaba.

Jesse: "Can we have a room?"
Bonnie(worker): "I'm sorry we're all booked"
Jackie (whisper): "Where are we gonna find a room at 1AM?"
Doris(Worker): "Wait, I'll be right back"

So Doris, who had a mullet and was missing some teeth went to check if we had a room available.  When she returned, sure enough we had a room....Zang.

So we went up and  cuz we were all sweatty from my no air-conditioned car, we warshed up (they way warshed in the U.P....stupid Yoopers, that's almost as bad as "Melk"...goddamn Melk, it's spelled "MILK"  M....Fucking I....L....K!!!!  I'd put it in bigger font, but this is just plain text for your UWMers out there that check your email through telnet.)  We finally hit the floor at like 2AM (Eastern).

So we walked around for a few minutes trying to find a table that was prime for the killing, and we came across a table with just one other guy there, and a $5 minmum bet.

So I broke out $60, and Jackie broke out $40.

After a hour or so, I ended with $160, and Jackie ended with $80.

We decided to cash-in and go to sleep.

The next morning we woke up and decided to play a little more.  We Warshed up again, and checked-out, and whne to play some more BlackJack.  This time we Each broke out 20$.

The force wasn't strong with me this time, as I lost the $20 in 15 minutes or so.  Jackie, however, stuck it out for another 15 minutes, and finally quit.  She left the tables with $17.50, so she only lost a few bucks.

Overall, Jackie won $37.50 and I essentially got a free room for the night (I won $80 and the room was $80).

We then proceeded to head for home, laughing at how trashy the U.P. was during the day.  It was like "Instant-clean" when we crossed the border to Wisconsin.


***Conclusion***
