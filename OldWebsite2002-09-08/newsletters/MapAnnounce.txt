Yo!

The South Shore Red Faction Map has been updated fairly substantially in the past few days.  I strongly advise checking it out.  Added recently is Theatre Number 1 is almost done, and after that is done, thne I will be doing a lot of copy and past to make the rest of the theatres.  After that is done, then the Booth comes next.  After the booth is done, the map will be availaible for download on the website as a beta version.  Then I will add the stock rooms and everything else like that.  And finally if I have time, I'll make a little bit of outside, but no promises on that.  I think beta will be ready for download in 2-3 weeks.

Additionally, the Message board has gotten a little more populare in the past few days . . . why don't you go post something useless to entertain us all.

Alrighty, and finally the usual:  Please RSVP.  I've had a few more that added themselves, but I'd really like to see everyone.

The password to RSVP is : [edited]

And of course, there are the mullet pics to see.  Everyone likes mullets.

It's all availaible at:
