Hi everyone, just a little update and some rants and some stories and some other useless shit.


***Hard Drive Failed***

Hey everyone . . . My hard drive failed.  Isn't that special.  So I've sent it to IBM to get fixed (although the data is lost forever).  Hopefully it'll be returned to me before LAN 3².  If it's not, then I'll be splurging and getting a 120 GB or 160 GB Hard Drive - it all depends on what I want more, speed or size.  The 120 GB is 7200RPM, where the 160 GB is 5400RPM, which isn't a terrible difference, but a 160 GB is certainly more expensive.

We'll see what happens.  If it's not here by a week before LAN, I'll order a new one.

The IBM website is pretty sweet, you enter model and serial number and it tells you if you HD is still under warranty.


***The Crusade***

Everyone has thier crusade.  I hate speeding tickets, and think that the speed limit should be raised.  Hippies like trees and animals, and think they are more important that human progress.  Christians love God, and think that everyone else should believe in such.  Microsoft loves money, and will do anything for it.  Black people hate white people, and think that they should pay for a humanity crime 150 years old.  Sorrell likes Hemp, and thinks it should be more widespreadly used.  Unger likes weed . . . And thinks it should be legal . . .

Well, I haven't directly stated my opinion on weed recently, as I have been mulling over this idea for a while.  Unger recently sent me a file with why the Drug-War violate3d humanity crimes, and I must sway that all the arguments are irrelevant to the purpose of the Drug-War.  I won't get into it in this medium, since this is not a discussion, only a one sided rant.  I did usta think that it should be legal, but recently I've been teetering over.  I've made up my decision, and Maybe you can figure it out by my following positions:

1.  It smells.  It's inconsiderate to those that don't smoke, if you smell like weed.  Sure, YOU may like it, but the 90% of society that doesn't, certainly won't like it.  I personally despise the smell.  I make no distinction between someone that smells like weed and someone who hasn't showered in a week.  I'm sure the unshowered person doesn't mind the say they smell, just as the weed smoker.

2. Stupidity.  Hmm.  According to Unger, every time he gets high, he says it makes him dumb for two weeks.  Maybe the reason it's illegal is because it makes anyone who smokes it unproductive.  Let's think of the vasta majority of those on welfare.  How many welfare, waste of life, shits do you think do weed?  I think that's pretty goddamn obvious.  In this case it's not the government "saving you from yourself" (with which I do disagree), but saving itself from inevitable destruction, by preventing "Weeders" from thriving.  If they were allowed to thrive, then the stupidity would spread, people would be less productive at work, businessess would fail because they wouldn't be very productive, our gross national product would lower, our economy would spiral into failure, we would all become a bunch of hippies, and then we would be killed by terrorists.

In conclusion, my opinion is, obviously, to keep marijuana and other drugs illegal.  You guys can go ahead and smoke away (and waste your money on something that last a few minutes or hours), I won't tattle or anything, but I feel that it is wrong, and very, very stupid.  Doing so damages your appearance as it makes it seem like you cannot have fun without getting high (just as I felt about drinking).  If you disagree with me, go ahead, but I'd like to see you prove it, and a claim like "Well i got along fine without it" isn't valid, as I sure as hell would have trouble having fun without a computer, but I did get along fine without one.  I also feel drinking is stupid, but do what you want, its your brain, not mine.

Why would anyone fight for drugs to be legal.  Let's just think about this for a second...

FIGHTING FOR SOMETHING AS STUPID AS DRUGS TO BE LEGAL!!  No not fighting for something useful, like animal cruelty, or global warming or any of those other liberal activist things, but for DRUGS.  Fucking DRUGS, which are KNOWN TO MAKE YOU STUPID!!!   JESUS CHRIST!!!  Watch TV, rent a movie, play a video game, become a soldier of fortune and kill people who steal cars, fight for a noble and just cause, not fucking DRUGS!!  Here's and idea, why don't we fight to set the driving age and the voting age to 12.  Then things would be way better. . . .

At least that's the intellegence level of someone who is high and is legally allowed to perform those actions.  Things would fall apart pretty quick.

I'm sorry if I have offended anyone, but I haven't really expressed an opinion in the past.  Just as a note, I have no beef with hemp aside from its ugly appearance (I don't think it's very attractive, but if Sorrell's claims are correct, then it is pretty damnm useful, and I wouldn't mind seeing hemp used more often for paper and stuff).

One more thing:  I don't want to hear anything about any of you guys' goddamned obsession with legalizing  stupidity (which includes both drinking and drugs), so don't bring it up around me.  Doing so from this point on will be taken as an insult.  And NEVER ASK ME TO ANY OF THAT SHIT, AS I MAY BE INCLINED TO PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.

I may be an asshole, but I am an asshole for my own protection from the forces of stupidity.


Finally on a lighter note (if any of your are worked up over this, just stop reading and continue when you cool down) ....

***Super Cool British Heatsink***

Recently I got a super cool, quiet heatsink from Great Britian, as it's the only place in the world that carries that type of heatsink.  It's sooooo quiet, i'm amazed.  It's nice not requiring that blasted Alpha heatsink I got from Derrick that is loud as a bloody jet plane (Derrick: I still owe you $15 for it, remind me at LAN).  With that heatsink, and my new Abit KR7A-Raid, I'll be attempting to overclock my Athlon XP 1800+ (1.53GHz) to 1.7 GHz.  Everyone that has it cooled to temps above that has massive fans or some form of liquid cooling or is using peltiers.

I can't afford all that extra stufff right now, so I'll just hafta live with it only overclocked to the equivinlant to XP 2100+.


***SoF2 Goes Gold***

Soldier of Fortune 2 : Double Helix has gone gold!

It's projected release date is the 21th of May, so we only got 2 days till happiness.

(if you are wondering what "gone gold" means, it means that the game has been sent to the CD presses for manufacturing and labeling and boxing and stuff.)

That game is amazing.  It's all i've been playing since the demo was released, and I intend on buying it on Tuesday, so I can make some massive copies for LAN Party.  It truly is a great game and I think you will all get a kcik out of blowing holes in chests and removing body parts, leaving the bones sticking out!!! Woo!!


***Warcraft III System Requirements***

Blizzard has released the specifications for the minimum system capable of running Warcraft III, when it retails.

Minimum:
400 MHz Pentium II or equivalent 
128 MB of RAM 
8 MB 3D video card (TNT, i810, Voodoo 3, Rage 128 equivalent or better)
700 MB HD space

Recommended(if it's not this fast it'll suck):
600 MHz processor 
256 MB of RAM 
32 MB 3D video card

Everyone go get your piles of shit upgraded.


***RSVP, Goddammit***

The RSVP Functionality is now working.  I'm sorry for everyone that actually tried to RSVP, but it's working now.  Go to the website and login.  You should be taken instantaneously to the Profile part (only if you haven't yet RSVPed).  Please RSVP so I can know who's all comin to the next LAN.  You can also RSVP for future LANs.  I obviously have a general idea  who's all comin, but if I think that not that many people are coming, I may not buy enough stuff.

So far 9 people are RSVPed, and 15 computers are signed up.  I'd like to see more.


***Star Wars Episode II***

Outstanding movie.  See it if you haven't.  I won't ruin the great stuff for you, but believe me, if it hasn't been ruined for you, than t he climax will be soo sweet you'll want to crap your pants.  I know I did, even thought I knew it was coming.  That's how sweet it is.

I just downloaded some of soundtrack on Kazaa and I love that soundtrack.  The Love theme is amazing, let me tell you.

Evan and I recently discussed that if we had Jedi like powers, we would most likly be Sith.  Evan likes this.  I, however, have way too much anger, and don't like that.  If only there weren't so many goddamn stupid people.

I'm ecstatic for Episode 3 (ohhhhhh man).


***Tacos are sweet***

Several years ago Slaw and Sean Kurtz (known to many as Tree) had a eat-off with Taco-Bell tacos.  Slaw wasted Sean 16 or 17 to 12.  Since Sean was working at south Shore this weekend, I've had the pleasure of bringing that up with him.  He said "I wanna rematch."  So I called brutha Slaw and proposed the challenge.  He accepted.  So Slaw and Sean will have another eat-off.

IT WILL BE AT THIS NEXT LAN PARTY.  Everyone feel free to place bets.

Saturday, June 8th.  Time for eat-off To be announced.


***Brian Stefanik and John Bastow***

Word on the street is that our good buddy Brian Stefanik's pictures are featured in a John Bastow commercial.  Lueck says watch ESPN sportcenter at like midnight for like an hour and it should come on.  He says he see's it practically every night.

I guess it has some before and after pictures.  I'll get an electronic version if I can get my hands on one (or make it).


***Profile stuff***

I'm working on the stuff for adding additional information to your profile, like quotes and favorite movies or something.  It's not done and I don't knwo when it will, but I'll do it eventually.


***Through the grapevine***

I ran into Laura Heise recently, and I've been informed that Goelz's ex-girlfriend, Erika Heise, is now engaged.  Sexy beast that she is...hehe.  Yeah I'm mean, so what.


***Puke Video***

Those of you that receive "The Slaw" have heard (or rather read) of the famous video of Gaynor drinking puke.  Well, Slaw says he'll be bringing the video to LAN PArty, so be prepared to see some of the funniest (and grossest) shit ever.  If you guys thought the piano stripper was disturbing, this will definatly blow your mind.  I haven't seen it yet, but I giddy just thinking about the disgust I will experiece as I take in the wonderful pictures of ingesting other humans' rejected fluids.


***Superimposing***

Nghi has a digital camera, so be ready for him to take both my and your pictures, just for the purpose of superimposing them on things.  He especially warned me that he'll be getting every angle of my head.


***Conclusion***

I once again would like to mention that you can do what you want, and even tell me about what you've done, but don't ask me to do anything.  I'll do what I want.  If I wanted to do something I would.

Well this was a pretty long one for while.  I've been working on this for several days, something I don't usually do: they normally take me a few hours.

Remember: LAN Party 3² is scheduled for June 8th, 2002 @ 5PM.
And setup will be the friday preceeding it (June 7th).  If you want to help out. just drop me an email or just show up at my house.  I should be home, but I may not (you never know), I may be out buying supplies.

My leg is numb right now, which is sweet.  When it gets completely numb, I'll go running around the basement and see if I collapse or not.  Maybe I will, maybe I won't.  Either way, it's gonna hurt, and it'll be cool("and by cool, I mean totally sweet" - http://RealUltimatePower.net )

Okay guys (and gals), I'll check you all later.  Enjoy whatever it is you're doing, but not before RSVPing!!!

You bloody bastards!!!
