***Red Faction 2***

Red Faction 2 has been announced!!  It's release date is yet unknown as it was announced only very recently.  Hopefully this game will be better executed than it's predecessor, as the idea for it is gold.  Too bad I never finished the map because of the engine limitations.

I have more information on the Website in the Games section

***Soldier of Fortune 2***

I went to Best Buy today to get my copy of SoF2, but hey had none.  I thought that maybe they had sold them all out, but whne I called tonight, they informed me that the game had not shipped to ANY Best Buys.  Hmmm.... that sucks.  She said to check back over the next few days, so I'll be checking them out.


***RSVP***

Please RSVP.  Go the website, log in, Sign up.  It's that simple.  Please do so, as there is only 2 1/2 weeks to go.

See you all at LAN!!!


***Friday LAN***

I'm considering hosting a LAN on a Friday night in August.  What do you guys think?  This will be the first deviation since last August, which flopped (but it was also oin a Wednesday night).  This will help accomodate the South Shore croud that has trouble making the others, particularly Klamecki and Castro.


***Conclusion***

4 Newsletters in 4 days.   Damn, I'm proficient (or relentless, whichever you prefer)!!

Mull over the idea of a Friday LAN, and I'll hold another survey soon.

Really quick one while I'm waiting for Jackie to wash up, I'll talk to you all later.

And Remember: 

LAN 3²: Saturday, June 8th @ 5PM
