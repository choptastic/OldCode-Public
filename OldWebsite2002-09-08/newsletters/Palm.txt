GummLANParty.net is now Palm Friendly.  You'll notice the last item on the menu bar is "Palm Version."  This links to http://www.gummlanparty.net/palm.asp

If you wish to add GummLANParty.net to your AvantGo Channels or use a real Palm Web Clipper, that's where you'll want to start.

Many of you are probably wondering why I all of a sudden make a very lightly trafficed website Palm enabled.  It's because I splurged and finally bought a Handspring Visor Prism.  16,000 Colors baby!  Ohhhhh yeah!  It's pretty nice, I even have a cool space shooter like the NES game 1942 but in space.

I have intentions on making a music generation program specifically for composers (like me) who would like to write music when it's thought of but don't have quite the ability to hear it in our heads.  This way I'll be able to hear what I write, when I write it.  Hope I can do it.

And how come no one is Registering with the Website.  c'mon, I thought it would be a little more popular than this.

That's pretty much it.
