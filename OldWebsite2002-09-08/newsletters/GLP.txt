Everyone, the GummLANParty.net Messanger is up and running.  It's very basic right now, but it'll get a more robust over time.

Current Features:

-=Instant Messanging (Works, no gay color schemes like ICQ and AIM though)
-=Messageboard Post Notification
-=IP Address info - Will tell you the IP Address of the Specified client.
-=Sadly, this doesn't do anything in terms of storage of information offline.  In other words, if you send a message to someone that is offline, they won't get it.


Future additions:

-=File transfer - will be more reliable than ICq because it will go through the server first. Firsthe client will upload the file to the server then the Server will notify the reciever that they have a file intended for them and they can download it from the server.
-=Offline Storage - storing a queue of information for users that are offline
-=Post a message on the messageboard without the web interface.
-=Chatroom - Make a big chatroom of people like gay AOL.  Could be fun.
-=Bug Reporting - Let me know if there's a problem using an official form built into the UI.
-=Announcements - Messages generated by the server sent to everyone, like : "LAN Party in 3 days" or something.
-=Website Update notification - lets the client know if the website has been updated
-=Updates available - Kinda like the critical update notification for Windows (but not as annoying or persistent) - Lets the client know there is a new version available for download.
-=Startup - Will Load, connect, and minimize on window startup.
-=Suggestions?  I'm open to any suggestions and bug reports.

Right now the code is pretty inefficient, considering I whipped this up pretty quickly.  If this becomes more heavily used I'll hafta clean up the code for better network usage, but until then, whatever.

Alrightythen, everyone, please download and remember:
