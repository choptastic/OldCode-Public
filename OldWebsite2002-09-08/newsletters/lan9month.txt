Yo everyone,

It's been a while since the last newsletter and I was cetainly hoping to get one out before this.  Anyways, there are a few things about which I'll talk.

***The Real World***
No, not the fucking MTV show, you know me better than that.  I wane everyone to register on the website and give me your goddamn snail mail address . . . I'll be sending physical newsletters to everyone.  It'll be fun.  MAybe I'll even burn some CDs and send them off.  I promise you, Gumm LAN PArty is not big enough for me to get any offers to sell your addresses to any kind of marketing company.  Plus, you niggas can trust me I'll never post that info on the web, in any form.


***Stories***

The Ninja: Several drunks drove a wheelbarrel to Gumm's house after sucking down plenty of Gin and Juice with Mr. Happy Crotch when Snoop-Doggy-Dog ate the leftovers . All of the Foriegners died painful deaths. Mississippi is full of people with pickup trucks.

Mr Rogers: "Would I die if i ate leftovers ? You could easily . But it snowed all fuckin retards and midgets with green thumbs and they died. Stupid Jews."

A great Projectionist Story: A long time ago Castro licked my anus. It tasted anus-ly good. So he worked a double. 

These are all examples of stories in the Stories section.  Get posting.  Make some new stories.  It's funny stuff.  Your allowed to post up to 20 characters (not just a single word).

***Solder of Fortune II Multiplayer Test***

Those of you pumped for SoF2, get ready for some madness, the Multiplayer test is out for Soldier of fortune 2:Double Helix.

Slaw was telling me just a little about the game, and how gory it is going to be.  There are soooo many different exit wounds areas, like 13 on the arm alone.  Team that up with the Quake 3 Engine, I think we're looking at a future big LAN Party Game.


***Games***

Here are just a few games I'm expecting to see at the next LAN:

-Quake 3 : Arena - go figure.  One of the best games ever.  Everyone loves it.  Everyone Plays it.  Every Gumm LAN Party so far has had it played.  Something tells me that it'll probably be played at the next LAN.

-Jedi Knight 2 : Jedi Outcast -  i'm installing this right now (which will make Castro happy).  I guess this is internet capable without the requirement of a CD Key.  Nice.  The best LAN Games are Copyprotection Free.

-Warcraft 3 : Reign of Chaos - I loved Warcraft: Orcs and Humans in '94.  then Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness was my favorite game.  Then Diablo.  Then I loved Starcraft.  I've never been really good at any of them, but (the same applies to War3 Beta), but I love Blizzard Entertainment.  I'm more loyal to them than to id software, despite my being better at id games.  Blizzard makes the best games, period.  They've never messed up an idea.  Every game has one at least one Game of the Year Award (with the execption of, I think, Warcraft 1)

-Medal of Honor : Allied Assault - World war II in the Quake 3 engine.  I've not yet played it, but it's supposed to be fun.

-Ghost Recon - PC Gamer's Game of the Year Baby!

Tetrinet - Does it need an explanation?


***Spiderman***

Those of you that saw Spiderman, excellent.  If you haven't, shame on you.  You are all required by the Law of Geeks to see Geek movies that are respectable.  If you didn't see Dungeons and Dragons, though, good job, cuz that movie is arguably my most hated movie.  Anyways, Spiderman had a record breaking opening Weekend, setting three records and setting the bar High for Attack of the Clones.

Biggest Opening Day : $41 million
Biggest Opening Weekend : $114 million
Biggest Single day : Saturday - $51 Million, I believe (but I may be wrong, this is off the top of my head, and I'm too lazy to look it up)

Tobey McGuire hit Good ol' peter right on the head.  And Willem Dafoe is slowly working his way up my favorite actor list (especially for his role in Shadow of the Vampire): he made the creepiest face in Spiderman.  Beautiful.

I ushed at South Shore for Spiderman Opening Weekend and I'll also be ushing for Episode 2, thankfully, I did not clean one Spiderman, however mad props go to Evan for Cleaning (blowing out) most of the spiderman shows this weekend.  Nice One Evan, you deserve a raise just for that.

Thanks to the fucking high schoolers at South Shore, we all had the privledge of working doubles on the BUSIEST WEEKEND IN MOVIE THEATRE HISTORY!!!  Nick doesn't work doubles and he worked two this weekend!  I personally worked around 25 hours this weekend, and I wasn't even working all that hard (i was cleaning the little shits).  I can't imagine what it was like for Evan, or *GASP* the Vendors!!  Considering how dumb the vendors are, shit!

In other news, I was ushing the other night and heard someone walk past Jason X and say "I heard that movie wasn't that bad."  What the hell is wrong with people.


***Who Would Win (And other Geeky debates)***

Proposed at South Shore sunday night, the argument is what would happen if a rail bolt from a rail gun would hit a light saber.  The topic is on the message board, check it.  Unger and I have already made some interesting points, I'd like to see other's opinions.

I also feel that to appease the Ubergeeks of us (particularly the comic nerds) that I'll be making a versus section like this for questions of the format : Who would win Between Blah1 and Blah2?

I'm sure Nick, Evan and Slaw will dominate that with occasional posts by Klamecki, me, Unger, and Sorrell, and of course lets not forget pictures of my head superimposed on anything and everything, courtesy of Niggy and Funger. 


***Cheap Magazine Subscriptions***

I just got a 3 year subscription to PC Gamer for $16 on eBay.  Hell yeah.  A Normal 1 year subscription from PC Gamer from the little cards inside is $25.  I've also gotten a subscription to Work at home Magazine for check this out: $1.48.  ONE DOLLAR AND FORTY-EIGHT CENTS.  Dude!


***Linux***

Linux is cool.  I apologize for you linux junkies out there for my previous rants about being forced to learn Linux.  I wasn't ready to lerarn linux, but now I am!  I've recently install Red Hat 7.2 and updated the kernel to the newest version, and I'm pumped to attempt some linux development, my first major linux program will more than likely be a GuLP Messanger port.

The deal with my previous rants is because I was forced to learn Linux, with no choice.  Which I find thoroughly bullshit.  It is also the reason I dropped out of UWM (Univ Wisc - My Nuts) last semester.


***New Award***

All the regular attendees know that Bill doesn't have a computer capable of playing the newer games.  Well, with his recent connections he was able to acquire several respectable computers, including a 800 Mhz Pentiumn (slow for us, but fast compared to his prevois 266 MHz powerhouse).  He is doing a lot of research on the water cooling and I believe he will have it working by the next LAN, his intentions are to run his 800Mhz at 1200Mhz, a substantial increase.  The new awards are for Fastest Overclock, absolute and percentage, and for sweet cooling systems.

I'v erecently been informed of a new liquid manufactured by 3m I believe, that is completely Non conductive.  That of course means that you can submerge your whole computer in this liquid to keep it cool.  How sweet is that?!?!  I'd get it if not for the $300/gallon price tag!  Sweet Stuff.


***GuLP Software*** 

For those parties interested, The deal with Marcus is getting closer and closer to a close.  Ill be getting my money and quitting my day job and prolly picking up a shift at South Shore, just so that I have a social life.  so far everything seems to be going pretty smoothly.

I just filed for LLC this past weekend, and when the stuff is processed, I'll legally own the company called GuLP Software, LLC.

Oddly enough I noticed a few weeks ago that GuLP could be changed to GULP (change the u to uppercase), thereby standing for Gumm Unger Lehmann Productions.  Nice, eh?

It could also be changed to GULPS . . . Gumm Unger Lehmann Productions with Soik  Wanna job Soik?!?  hehe, just kidding.


***Conclusion***

Alrighty nuh niggas, now's the time to remind you all of the next LAN Party!!!

Saturday June 8th, 2002 @ 5PM.  My Basement.  It's swell.

Come to this fucker, it'll be huge!!

Why not help out with Setup, I'll be taking off work the day before so that I can do setup.  I would imagine that Bill and Unger will help out, and I'm sure Josh Klamecki will make an appearance.

RSVP Section will be up by the end of the week!!

"Hi, my name is Steve. I come from a rough area. I used to be addicted to crack but now I am off it and trying to stay clean. That is why I am selling magazine subscriptions."

Later...
