A few things... nothing crazy.

***People Skins for Quake 3***

Since the wholoe making maps thing Unger and I did totally failed, I've decided to take on a less strenuous task.  I'll be making skins for as many of the LAN Party Attendees as I can before LAN A.  I'm not gonna make models, cuz that's just too much.  Just Skins.  They may not even be good.  Who cares?  I'm doing it any way.  Ma yber I'll make some other various skins as well, like Joel, Poulson, and Doughty (though I'd probably hafta make a new Model for doughty).


***FTP Access***

In light of recent events where Nigh and his buddies at work have downloaded a few gigs from my FTP Server, I'll be disabling the FTP Server at any time that I am experiencing lag during games.  MY brother also plays frequently, so if he wants to play, It will be disabled then as well.

Assume the FTP Server will be on between 4am and 10am every morning.  And sometimes during the day.  Sorry for the inconvenience, but it's an inconvenience to me.  So There.


***Fat People***

I've recently been informed of one of the most rediculous lawsuits yet.  Apparently, a bunch of fat peopel are suing Food companies (Fast food joints) because they are overweight.  They are trying to make the food places not put so much fat in thier food, or something like that.


***Show me the Monet***

Recently, within a week or so, the WaterLilies Seriese of painting by Claude Monet (Pronounced mo NAY), has not been in the public eye for more than 70 years.  And for the first time it that 70 years, they've finally been in the public eye in a public auction: Where they sold for a whopping 20 million dollars.  Super Sweet!!

No I did not misspell "Show me the Monet"  The pun was very very intended.


***Really Really Big People***

I was listening to Art Bell the other day and he was discussing the possibility of Giants in history.  Apparently, we've found skeletons of homonids from some 250,000 years ago or so that are anywhere from 8-18 feet tall.  Those are some big people.  Anthropologists also acknowledge the existence of them and 

Not only does science back it up, but in almost all cultures' folklore, you'll find several stories mentioning the existance of Giants, INCLUDING the Old Testament : Goliath.  There are many skeletons of Giants in Minnesota where, if memory serves me correctly, the Chippawa tribe was.

This is backed up by old Chippawa tales.  The Giants for whatever reason invaded the Chippawa, but the Chippawa was a fierce tribe and they defeated them.  That's the story in short.


***Bjork and Enya***

For those of you wanting more reasons to make fun of me, I just downloaded a ton of Bjork and Enya Music.  It's funny cus since I downloaded that music, I haven't even 10 peopel try to download from me.


***Flying Alternative***

Here's an intersting idea.  Take it as you like.  What if we, as an alternative to airplanes, connected the whole country via bullet train.  They travel at close to 200MPh, and it would be cool to just buy a ticket and board, rather than going through that the hub-bub of security on an Airplane.  Just an Idea.


***Warcraft 3***

Everyone remember that Warcraft 3 comes out on Wednesday July 3rd (exactly a week from today).  Also remember that this release is going to be the biggest game release in history (however, I'm not sure if this includes all video games, or just PC Games)  but in any case, this is certainly going to be huge.  I'm exstatic.

Also remember that there is a Warcraft 3 LAN Party on Saturday, July 6th @ 5PM.

Be There.  And Remember to RSVP on the website in your profile.


***Conclusion***

Not much for game news this time, but there hasn't really been anything totally worth mentioning.  Whatever, I'll see you later

LAN War3 : Saturday July 6th, 2002 @ 5PM

LAN A : Friday August 23rd or Saturday August 24th, 2002 @ 5PM.
