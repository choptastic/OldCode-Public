Several of you have expressed some form of anger over this most recent newsletter.

There is a reason that I stopped following politics (I'll still listen to Belling every once in a while, but overall, I've given it up).

This reason is because of how heated I get.  My opinions are very conservative, which means that they are sure to offend someone, since the stereotype view of republicans is that they are assholes.  So I gave up politics because of my fear of insulting a friend, which certainly happened here.  You'll not hear anything of this topic again from me.

So I'd just like to apologize to everyone whom I've insulted for insulting them.  You are all my friends, and I'd hope that something as trivial as a Rant won't end that.  I do NOT however aoplogize for my opinions, as they are right and anything else is wrong.  hehe.

Have your opinions, express them, get people pissed.

I'll be implementing a rant forum soon. where you can use it to send a message to everyone on the contact list.  Every rant posted sent as a newsletter and will be stored and posted on the site in a "Rant" page or something.

I'd just like to add one thing...What you do in your own home is fine by me, but once it goes public (or once you go public under it's influence, even if it's not on you), then that should be illegal.
