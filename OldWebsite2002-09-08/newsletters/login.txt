The website is back up!!

Well there's a few more things to say than just that.

First and most importantly, Congratulations to Nghi for being on of the 5,000 out of over 100,00 being chosen to be a Warcraft 3 Beta tester.  The irony of it, though, is that Nghi is one of the LAST people we want to get it before the rest of us.  Now there's no Chance in Hell of any of us every beating him, save Bee.

Next, an important breakthrough in 3D technology: nVidia announced the GeForce4 yesterday (I think it was yesterday).  So those of you that think you have the baddest ass Video Card around, once the GF4 comes out in March, you'll not have the best.  But I am considering buying myself one.  so Far there are the Ti4400, Ti4600, and the MX series of GF4 cards.  The 4600 will be around $400, and 440 will be around 300 and the MXs will be around $200.  and the ti4600 does 1.26 TRILLION operations per seconds . . . talk about fast as a high school slut.  Damn nigga!

Finally, The Website has a slightly new functionality to it.  No longer can anyone post, or suggest a game.  Now one must be a registered logged in user.  This is a very simple process found at many forum sites around the globe (however, the code is written solely by me, I think I'm turning this website into a resume quality site).  Anyways, the procedure takes about 2-5 minutes.

First you must Click "No Login? Register" above the menu bar on any page.  Then enter your imformations nad Submit it.  Then chekc your email and go the URL provided and enter the activation code specified in the email.

That's it.  Now you are a member.
