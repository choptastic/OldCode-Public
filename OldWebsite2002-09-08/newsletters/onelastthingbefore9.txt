Hello, one last thing before LAN 9, tomorrow.  Hopefully most of you will check your email.

***Preburned Games***

Please bring any CDs that you have taken for the past LAN Parties, if you still have them.  I am running sort of low on CDs and i would just appreciate if you brought all your own stuff.  Understandable that most of you don't actually have any of my copies, and that's why I make all those copies.  However, i'm sure you understand how expensive it is to burn 30-50 CDs and just give them away.


***Headphones***

Please remember to bring headphones or speakers.  Headphones are much more preferred, however, but speakers are just fine.  Personally, I think headphones are better for yourself because you can ignore all the "real life" surroundings and pay attention to the sounds of the game.


***I am a ninja***

Yup... it's true.

One more day to go!!

wuwu...poop in a shoe!!
