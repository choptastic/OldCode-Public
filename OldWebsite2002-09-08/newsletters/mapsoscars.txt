Guten Morgen (es ist sehr frueh morgan).

Well it's now two days after the oscars.  Everyone should be calmed now.

***Website***

Here's the newest thing with the website.  I've had some MAJOR updates on the website, and a strongly advise everyone to take a look at it, perhaps post a few messages.

1. Pictures and Hyperlinks on the message board.  After months of harrassment from Nghi to add image support on the messageboard, I've finally added the support so Nghi can harrass me even more.

2. FAQ for the GuLP Messenger.  Usage of the messenger has increased, and per Nghi's request (and a bit of common sense), I've added a Frequestly Asked Questions(FAQ) for the GuLP Messenger.  It's pretty easy to find, just click on "GuLP Messenger" from the menu, then click on "FAQ" or whatever.  Feel free to submit questions.

3. Maps Section.  This is for Maps that have been finished or are currently in development.  So far only Unger and I are making maps.

4. PiaS Screenshots.  I've finally activated the PiaS link.  It's pretty stupid right now, as it only has screenshots of my brother and I winning at Quake and CS.  If any of you wish me to add you to the screenshots, be my guest.  You are all Poop in a Shoe members, as officially, anyone who attends the LAN Parties, are PiaS Members, except Andy, cuz he's a liberal whiney, mutherfucker that accuses me of being a bad employee.  the bitch.


***Mobo Map***

I'm currently working on a CTF Motherboard map for Quake 3 Arena.  If it sucks, then it sucks, but even Jackie is pumped for it.  It's pretty sweet, check out some of the screenshots in the "Game Maps" Section.  I'm getting pretty close finishing, as I've wasted the last two days of my life working on it.  I intend on adding a CPU fan, and possibly a chipset fan that will be spinning and kill on contact.  Pretty cool, eh?  check it out on the "Game Maps Section."

If any of you make any maps, I'll be glad to post them on the site, for download with some screenshots.


***The Oscars***

I bet most of your weren't expecting me to make a reference to the Oscars, but I must express my deepest newly developed hatred for the oscars.  The big reason of course is for the length of time it takes to fucking hand out a goddamned award.  I only watched an hour and a half of it, and during that time they handed out like 4 awards, thats 1 every 22.5 minutes.  A little too long for my patiance.  Aside from that, i also have beef with several winners.  

Put briefly:  

Nicole Kidman should have won best actress, not that whiney, half-black bitch that only won because the NAACP said so, Halle Berry.  Bull shit.

Moulin Rouge should have won best picture.  Best movie of the year, goddammit.

Moulin Rouge or Memento should have won editing: granted I didn't see Blck Hawk down, but shit, memento is in reverse order and moulin rouge does like 3 shots a second, for extended periods of time.

AI should have taken visual effects:  C'mon, half a face attached to a robot body!!  That's great stuff.

Harry Potter should have taken Score:  This isn't as bad, as LOTR was my second choice.

So that's my beef.

I have no intentions of watching the oscars again, as I don't have 4 hours of my life to waste watching the little slut cry so badly that she can't even fucking talk.


***More Games***

Alright, I alraedy told you about Doom 3, so here are two more games of importance:

Many of you know Warcraft 3, since the beta is out and Nghi was lucky enough to get it.  Cool.   Many of you also know that there is a LAN Party on the Saturday that War3 comes out.  If it comes out on Tuesday (for instance), then LAN Party is that Saturday, immediatly after.  I'll be imforming you when an official date is announced.

I'll also be holding a LAN Party when Duke Nukem Forever is finally released.   I know very little about it, as the website is very vague - The release date for DNF is officially "When it's done". . Seriously.


***Skool***

Once again, I am feeling similar to how I felt last semester (though not as bad).  I hate school, and I think this might be my last year.  As most you know, Counts is entering it's final stage, and I'll be getting some money from Marcus soon (approximatly $9000).  This will hopefully allow me to quit my job and start a business making software for Movie Theatres.  If all goes well, I'll not need to get another job again, as I'll be selling software to theatre chains.

Do keep in mind that this is the ideal plan, nothing is set in stone.  


***Finally***

Gumm LAN Party 3²:
Saturday, June 8th,

I'm going for a terrabyte of hard drive space here, let's see if we can do it!!

No one has tossed around any Tourney ideas, yet, I'd like to see some ideas on the board while I prepare the Tourney Suggestions section of the website.

K i'm tired and still have homework.

Guten Nacht,
