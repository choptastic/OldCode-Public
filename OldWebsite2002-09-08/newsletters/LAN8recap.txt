My fellow Über Geeks (referenced in "The Slaw"):

LAN 8 is so quickly come and gone, so it's time to look to LAN 3² (3 squared).  There are several plan I have already to try and attract more people to our LAN Parties.  For those of you at the most recent LAN, I'm sure you all noticed the lack of regulars.  We even saved the Asians thier spot in the corner, but it was all in vain.  They just didn't show.

Before we get to discussing the Next LAN, though, I'd like to take the time to discuss this most recent LAN.

Chronology:

It started with promise.  Josh Klamecki came at 2:30 kicking it off.  Shortly thereafter, Sorrell and goelz stopped by to drop off Sorrell's computer (however he returned very late and never played on it, instead it just sat in my closet without a monitor).  Bill, of course, was there helping with set up.  When the LAN finally took some momentum, Red Faction began with the South Shore map.  This lasted for a while, while I was trying to get others online.  dissapointingly, I never got te oppurtunity to play on my own map.  Oh well.  

when Red Faction began to sizzle down (and it did so because Red Faction is gay), Alien vs Predator tried to take the stage, but the measures Fox had taken to prevent piracy prevented a strong game from ever forming, that sizzled down after a not long time.
After the failed attempt to play avp2, people went thier own way for a while.  I tried setting up the N64 on the projector, just to not find the RF adapter.  My brother and his friends played thier holy grail, counterstrike, Slaw, Evan, and Mark all played medal of honor, and the rest either milled around, played nintendo, or played tetrinet.

Around 2 or 3am, Quake3 took the stage, as tradition dictates.  I had finally given up on troubleshooting others computers, and I was going to play Quake, goddammit!!  And so we played.  It was okay, but it lacked the energy usually associated with Quake (I think this is partially sue to the fact that Fleming, the asians, and Castro weren't there.

Finally, we had our Tactical shooter cool down, with Ghost Recon.  This Lasted until about 8am.  we had our fun, and it seemed Slaw was the best at that.  I went to sleep at like 8:30, but Slaw remained, playing with my brother.


Consoles:

We had a wide array of consoles: NES, SNES, N64, DC, PS2, and XBox.  Thanx to several people for bringing Consoles I'll be making an Award for that when I get home tongight(I'm at School right now). Thanx everyone who brought consoles (we needed to keep Russ contained in Techmo Bowl).

We also had a projector thanx to Bill's uncle.  This particular projector had a great picture and huge screen at such a short throw.  It took up the whole wall except for a foot or so on the bottom.  Too bad the bulb burned out while using it and we had to get one of South Shore's 230W bulbs to use in place of the 400W bulb that the projector needs.  So the picture wasn't that great after that.


Various Other Stuff:

Well in terms of troubleshooting, this was hardly a bad one.  My middle computer (1.3 GHz, Geforce3 Ti200, 256 RAM) stopped working consistently around 4PM (according to my brother and his friends).  I don't know the cause yet, but It seems as though it has stabled, as I weas able to play a few games of Quake with Jeff yesterday without it locking.  Nicks computer was on a frenzy, and I haven't gotten a chance yet to look at it.  I'll try tonight, Nick.  Finally Josh Klamecki formatted his Hard Drive as something was acting funny . . . a week earlier he had scored in the upper 6000's in 3D Mark, but at LAN we was scoring a measly 2000.  With a GeForce3,  I think not!  So he formatted and things went back to normal.  Don't know, couldn't tell ya.

Amy Coined a new word for us.  It means money in Am-ish (not to be confused with Amish, which, as we learned while moving Klamecki's mom's Amish Couch around means, Goddamn Fucking Innefficient No Screw using bastards).  The new word: Benjermans.  That's right Benjermans.  I guess there was a movie called "All about the Benjermans."  Must be a sequal to "All about the Benjamins."  hmm.


No Asians:

Usually the backbone of any LAN Party, the asians were nowhere to be found.  We tried looking in caves, and under rocks but they were gone.  We even tried the local Asian Food Store, and Wong's Wok.  All to no avail.  Nghi and Bee, where the hell were you!?!  hehe.


Statistics:

Here's a new addition to the recap of the LAN Party: Statistics.  These can also be found on  the website in the "Statistics" section.

Total Number of Fast Computers: 16
Collective CPU Speed: 19.533 GHz
Total RAM: 6272 MB 
Total Hard Disk Space: 705 GB 
Average CPU Speed: 1220.8125 GHz 
Average RAM: 392 MB 
Average Hard Disk Space: 44.0625 GB 

A Little over half a terabyte.  Next LAN we better be over a goddamn Terabyte (I should have an 80 or 100 Gig by then.  I'd also like to see us nail 10 Gig of memory.  Imagine the power if we made a cluster of all them computers.  We'd have a damn powerful web server.

Conclusion of LAN 8:
 
So Sadly, this was hardly the LAN it could (and should) have been.  But it's past and we need to look on to the next one.  Part of the problem was that I hyped up 7 to this monstrous size, and then sent out a few emails about 8 (Thanx to unger for pointing this out to me).

Despite it's shortcomings, this was indeed the most organized LAN to date.

What went Wrong:
-Not enough hype resulting in low turnout (however we were graced with brother DeWitt's appearance, whose lost about 40 pounds in the Marines.  Sweet Deal, now I need to lose some weight, cut I'm a fat-ass.
-The Bulb burned out in the projector and we had to rely on a backup shitty bulb from South Shore.
-The Pickles were supposed to be whole dills man, not shitty slices.  We made due though, at least the pickles were cold and crisp.
-Games were very unorganized and seemed uninspired (except for Slaw and Mark, who always have enthusiasm).  Yelling "Game number two!!" was a nice touch Mark.

What went right:
-Very organized, come over, plug into the network, and go.  That was it, very little "on the fly" network cable making.
-We were well behaved enough that my mom didn't get all pissed off cuz she couldn't sleep.
-There were a ton of games to choose from, and the Utilities CD helped out most (It was a little difficult to make some of the games go, though).  We need to find a game that is easily piratable (like Quake3).
-Lots of people we're not used to seeing came, like the Dewitts and Stefanik, and Steph and Kristen, who haven't been to a LAN Party since LAN 4 (Arguably the best one so far).


The Future:

I have lots of ideas to try to attract more people to the next one, here are just a few (soon to be enumerated on the website):

-Tournaments: I'd like to have a tourney with a prize or prizes of some sort: Money, Hard ware, Consoles System, Game, whatever.  This will soon be it's own section on the Website, Tournament Suggestions.  Any suggestions are appreciated.  Obviously we won't be holding a Starcraft Tourney because the Asians would win in a heartbeat, for example.  We need a game or games that everyone knows to a degree.  I'm thinking of doing a collective system.  Whos the best at 3D Shootem ups, 3D Tactical, RTS,  Maybe a breakout tie breaker or something.  For instance, If Nghi kicks ass at the RTS game, but get his ass pounded at the 3D games, where Bee does say, second place in all three, Bee would place over Nghi.  Something like that.  The difficulty is in finding someone willing to pitch in, say, $5 for an entrance fee.  Think and submit ideas on the forum for now, and later on the Designated Tournaments page.

-Free Stuff: This goes along with the Tournaments part or if I were to charge an entrance fee for the LAN Party itself.  I will be randomly selecting a particular day, then randomly selecting from within that Day, a post from the Message board.  Whoever made that post will receive free admission to something for the Next LAN Party.  The reason I do it this way is to try to get people to post on the message board, and this is better than just choosing a random post because it forces people to post every day.  For instance, if Bill makes 1000 posts on one day, but Joe posts once a day, Joe will have a better chance of winning the raffle.

-More Hype:  I'll be sending out actual paper flyers for the next LAN to those who have registered.  If you have registered, but have provided me with a bogus address, I will be emailing you requesting your real snail mail address.  Expect these emails this weekend.

-GuLP Finalization: I also intend on having a fully distributable version of the GuLP Messenger available and tested before LAN 3².  For those of you that haven't tried it yet, it's pretty cool.  It's still got some pretty big bugs in it, but it changes almost every day.  So far Unger, Slaw, Jeff, Ian, Klamecki, and Myself all use it regularly.

-Reimplelented Game Voting.  I took this down after implementing the login feature, but I'd like to re-implement.

-More profile options:  Quotes, Movies, Pictures, all that jazz.

-Any Suggestions, complaints, send them to me.


Reminder: 
Gumm LAN Party 3² (3 squared)

Nice and Big:

POST ON THE GODDAMN MESSAGE BOARD.  I PUT IT THERE FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE POSTS.  DON'T JUST READ IT, YOU NEED TO POST AND LET THE WORLD KNOW HOW YOU FEEL (even though the whole world doesn't know about GummLANParty.net, eventually it will, so be one of the first to ever to associated with the GummLANParty.)

It'll be nice to see some people on the Forum besides the usuals: Me, Unger, Sorrell, Jeff, and Slaw.

Later dudes, I skipped class to write this so you better be damn appreciative (ya know cuz I rarely skip class).

-Gumm (Chops)
