Get onto 13th St. and Head South (Away from Rawson)
Go though the stoplights at Drexel Ave.
Turn left at Peutz (it'll be a 4-way Stop Sign)
Go Straight for about two and a half miles (you'll go through a stoplight after a mile or so)
Turn left on Riverton (the only road between Pennsylvania Ave and 15th Ave)
Go straight through the 4-way stop.
I'm the third house on the left.
