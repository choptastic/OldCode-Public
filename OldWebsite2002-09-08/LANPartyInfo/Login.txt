The Login feature will allow you to interact with the website.  You may not post on the forum, add a word to a story, suggest a game, vote for anything, or pretty much do anything without a Login.  The process is simple.  Give me your information (including a valid email Address) and you'll be automatically sent an email with an activation number in it.  You'll use this number to Activate your account, allowing you to interact with the website.

I also strongly advise providing me with a Valid Snail Mail Address, to which I can send physical newsletters.  I've alrdy sent one physical newsletter, expect more before LAN 11 (in January)

The GuLP Messenger was doing well for a while, but due to the fact that it was poorly designed and sort of half-ass built, it's popularity has declined a bit.  I intend on making it better eventually, but not just yet.  Additionalyl the popularity of the forum has died off rather rapidly, and that is quite dissappointing, since at it's price it was getting close to 50 posts a day.  The current Online Record for GuLP is 6 people concurrently on the GuLP MEssenger.  It still has a long way to go, but it's useful if you want a chat without the gay ass smileys and ads.  It also has a countdown to the next LAN Party (arguably the most usefull feature).
