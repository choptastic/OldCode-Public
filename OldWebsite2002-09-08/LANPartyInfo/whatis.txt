A LAN Party is the coolest thing since neon spandex.  It's where a bunch of guys(and occasionally a few girls) get together and play computer games networkerd together for ultra fast response times.  If you don't know what ping is, it's the amount of time in milliseconds it takes for a message to be sent from you to a server and back.  At a LAN Party, you'll get an average ping of 5 or 10.  Even with cable modem or DSL you're lucky to get a ping of 50 and on 56K Dialup, expect your ping to be around 250 (50 times slower than a LAN).  So LAN Parties are cool.

Everyone must bring thier computer.  Some people do't have computers and that's why some people bring several computers.  That way everyone gets to play.  Awards get handed out (via email) after each LAN Party, and I keep track of all computers and make a statistics page out of them.

I've just begun to plan out Tournaments.  The first tourney is scheduled for LAN Party A on Saturday August 24th, and the first price is a Digital Camera.  The Second price is a rare finding in society due to the old people hoarding them due to the fact they they are "worth" more than they are... A Sacajawea One Dollar Coin.

Additionally, my girlfriend, Jackie, is scheduling a Golden Eye and Mario Kart Tourney for N64 and Super Nintendo (respectivly), with the winners recieving champion belts, that she intends to make.

Now I try to make mine a little different.  I have several friends who aren't Hardcore Gamers - people who don't really like playing computer games.  So for them I get Projectors and Console systems (because everyone loves Tetris).
