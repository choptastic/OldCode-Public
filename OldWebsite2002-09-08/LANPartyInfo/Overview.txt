Most of you viewing this site are familiar with my LAN Parties, and I'm sure the vast majority of you have actually been to some, if not all, of them.  We all remember the first monumental LAN where I was troubleshooting my computer until 6AM, when I finally started playing games, namely Rainbow 6.

Well LAN 7 was huge and disorganized.  LAN 8 was smaller, but much more organized. LAN 9 was both huge and organized, with everyone coming in the first few minutes of the start time of 5PM (a rather unusual occurance).  War3 LAN was an awesome turn out compared to what I was expecting, due to the very focused nature of that LAN PArty (a celebratrion of the release of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos).

I always have lots of copies of lots of different LANable games : Warcraft 3, Quake 3, Ghost Recon, Soldier of Fortune 2, Alien Vs Predator 2, etc..

I've recently restructured the Network, making it far easier to set up the network... all we hafta do is drop some wires from the ceiling, and attach a hub, and we're off.  All that's left is cleaning the damned basement.
