        <p align="left">Yup, for my mother's Halloween Party, I went as White 
          Trash Man, sporting such fashionable duds as a Dale Earnhart Jr, Shirt 
          and Zubas, and of course topping it all off with a nice dosage of mullet. 
          Probably the funniest thing about that is I actually managed to offend 
          two people. This will be even funnier for those of you who know these 
          people. Sarah Buerger, a young'un (about 10 or 12 years old) <b>actually 
          started crying</b> when she say me grinding my Dale Earnhard shirt into 
          the Garage floor to give it that nice, &quot;White Trash Clean&quot; 
          look to it, with oil stains andw such. She really likes Nascar . . . 
          how sad. Corrupted by her family early on.</p>
        <p><b><font size="4">The Kicker</font></b><br>
          TYLER BUERGER WENT AS DALE EARNHART JR.!!!</p>
        <p>haha</p>
        <p align="center">Needless to say, he promptly went home and changed into 
          standard street cloths.</p>
        <p align="left">But it was so sad, because the adults in attendance at 
          this party didn't seem to get it. They didn't get what was up weith 
          my hair . . . &quot;It doesn't look so bad,&quot; said my OWN MOTHER. 
          I was dissappointed, to say the least.</p>

      <p>So in summary (and I'm going to make this big and easily readable):</p>
      <p><font size="7">Nascar is a sport made by White Trash for White Trash. 
        Any affiliation or support thereof almost always instantly drops you into 
        the &quot;white trash&quot; category . . . even if you are black.</font></p>
