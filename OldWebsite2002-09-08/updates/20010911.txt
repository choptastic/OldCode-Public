As most of you well know, America was attacked on home soil today.  Nostradamus predicted that a man with a blue turbin would rise and start the third World War.  For you unfortunate souls that have never heard of Nostradamus, he was a guy in the mid part of last millenium (1400s or 1500s) that predicted pretty much everything.  He predicted two anti-christs (Napoleon and Hitler) and both World Wars, as well as the assasination of Kennedy (his words were something like 'A Great Leader will be struct down by lightning.'  Well it just so happens that the THIRD anti-christ predicted by Nos, happens to be around the year 2000 by a guy with a blue turbin.  Well Fuckin-A!!

If this war would be fought in Quake, bin Laden would be done.

On a lighter note, Red Faction comes out in a week.

The date,time and location of LAN Party 7 has not yet been affected.
