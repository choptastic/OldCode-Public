Well I've made the Menu links SUBSTANTIALLY less ugly.  I like the new layout, but I'm still thinking how to make it better, cuz I know it's not perfect yet.  That's pretty much it for remodeling.

I've also added the Newsletter section for past newsletters sent out.  Anything I think is not deemed public is censored out, such as passwords and the like.

I still don't have full-version Red Faction even though it's out(it should be at least).  I'm just going to have to play the Multiplayer demo until I get some money to buy it.
