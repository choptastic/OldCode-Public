Of Course, I never make backups of anything, which is why I'm surprised I've never lost all my MIDIs.  Anyways, I saved my South Shore Map, and closed the editor. When I reopened the program and tried to open the map, I get a critical error and must restart the program.  So, that kinda sucks . . . I hafta restart the map from scratch, and I was practically done with the cafe, and I was working on the vending stand.  Luckily it was only 3 days into it, rather than 2 months into it.  So the screenshots will stay where they are as a remembrance of the original.
