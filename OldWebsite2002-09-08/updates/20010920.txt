It's been a short while since I updated last.  I didn't feel like updating it.

Well I updated the Games section.  Now you can Vote for the game you want to see played most at LAN Party.  Check it out and vote for a game.

I also suggest, if you are new to the site, adding yourself to the Contact List if you are interested in attending the next LAN Party.
