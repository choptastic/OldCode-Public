Check out the South Shore Map Pics . . . Jeff and I played our first test with 6 theatres.  We hit the 128 Geo-Mod Limit and the game didn't crash for either of us with 6 theatres.  YEAH!!  There's some really sweet pictures.

Most of you knopw that I was forced to remove the seats from the theatres because I was having huge problems with it crashing because of, i guess, too much detail.  So there will be no seats in the South Shore Map.  But I think it's better without the seats.
