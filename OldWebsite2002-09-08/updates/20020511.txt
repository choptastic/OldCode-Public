Well there is RSVP Functionality up now.   To RSVP for a LAN Party, Login and edit your profile.  If you don't have a login, use the "No Login? Register" Link under the Login Area.

When you are logged in, you can then view all the currently scheduled LAN Parties, and sign up for whichever ones you plan on attending.

To View the current status of the LAN Party (who's all comin, and howm any computers are coming, check out the Statistics Section.
