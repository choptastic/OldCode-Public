Well I finally went and bought Red Faction.  I had a hellova time though.  There were NO copies in ANY Best Buys in the Milwaukee Area (Racine, Milwaukee, and Waukesha).  So I was reduced to go to Wal-Mart.  Anyway, I've been playing quite a bit, probably 6-10 full games a day or so, and I win about 70% of them,. so I think that I'll be a good source for a strategy guide.

<b>So the Red Faction <i>Multiplayer</i> Strategy guide is now underway!</b>  I'm looking forward to finishing it, then opening GummLANParty.net to the public.

A Survey of the Week is beginning, of random questions and stuff.  At the end of the week, the results will be posted.  I'm working on that tonight.

I'm also workin on the T-shirts.
