I am currently workin on a Map of South Shore for Red Faction that is projected to be released by the end of November.  Hopefully this is an overestimate, but at the latest, it'll be out by Jan 5, which, of course, is LAN Party 7.

I'm also thinking of getting personalized License Plates, but I'm not sure, that'll be next weeks poll.
