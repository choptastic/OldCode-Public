There is a new Warcraft 3 gameplay preview.  Go get it from <a href="http://www.blizzard.com">Blizzard Entertainment</a>.  It's very cool.

I went out and bought the Pre-Order of Red Faction the other day.  It includes a Copy of the coundtrack in CD.  I must say, I am impressed.  Some of it is very reminiscent of Duke Nukem 3D.  It's very good stuff.  Red Faction comes out in the 18th of this month, so I'm pumped.

I've been playing lots of the demo version, and I'm getting pretty good.

That's it, go to the message board.
