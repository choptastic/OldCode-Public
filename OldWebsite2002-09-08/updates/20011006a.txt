Well Now, I've been making some better backups of my stuff becuse I made a program automatically do that for me.  Anyways, I'm talking about the restarting of the South Shore Map.  I started it tonight, and I've learned it's a bit easier to add the details as you go.  Check it out, the cafe rebuilt and better than ever.
