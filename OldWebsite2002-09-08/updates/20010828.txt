Hey, y'all.  This site is finally up.

You computer nerds will notice that every extension on this site is a .ASP.  This ENTIRE Site is database powererd: The Menu, The update that you are reading, the computer in the computers section.  I also realize that this makes me kind of susceptable to hackers, but anyoine who'd waste thier time bustin this site, obviously has nothing else to do.

I just recently made the find of a lifetime: all 32 Beethoven Piano Sonatas for $30, and with 11 discs, that's less than $3 a disc.  Let me tell you, I'm pumped.

k, Bye.
