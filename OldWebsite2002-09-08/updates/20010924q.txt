Today I installed Quake 3.  I haven't had it installed since I upgraded to Win2K a few months ago.  It's probably been 2 or 3 month ssince I last played Q3A.

So I installed it, and played.  Sure enough, I still won, even on a server of like 15.  Needless to say, I've impressed myself.

I plan on beginning reading the book "Learn Computer Game Programming with DirectX 7.0"  Which I hope will give me a firm understanding of Windows based programming.  I mean, the only games I've ever made are for DOS in C++.  I Need Visual C++, and since my Fucking Liberal let's Use only Unix school doesn't give me the necessary knowledge to program in Windows, I'm foreced top do it on my own.  Isn't that kind of bullshit.  It took me 2 years now to realize that UWM has a BAD fuckin' Computer Department.  I am a JUNIOR Goddammit, and I don't know Visual C++!!!  WTF!!

I Seriously need to go to Full Sail or something.  Full Sail is a Game School where they have AN ENTIRE MAJOR Called "Game Design."  Too bad it's in Florida and i'm in Wisconsin.  I Need to find somewhere that offers Visual C++.  It wouln't bother me really if they offered VC++ but Required Unix, but they only OFFER Unix!! fuck that.  Even my Web Server is Microsoft.  I Like ASP.

And With Going to School, Two Jobs, and a girlfriend (Yes some computer nerds are fortunate enough to have girlfriends), I don't really have time to program on my own.

K, i'm done ranting.

I also sealed my Nerdiness with the books I recieved via mail today.  I joined a book club for Math and Sciences, and with the membership you get 5 free books.  The books I recieved are as follows:
e: The Story of a Number
Zero: The biography of a Dangerous Idea
The Joy of Pi
To Infinity and Beyond
And Imaginary Tale: The Story of The Square Root of -1

Ooooooh yeah.
