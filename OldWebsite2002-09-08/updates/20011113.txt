Got some new pics of THE Map.  Things are really starting to fall into place.  I began workin on Theatre 1, which will be able to be copied for theatre 3 and theatre 16, and just flipped for 2, 4 and 15.  It'll be modified for 8, 9, and 10, the only wierd ones will be in the new section.  This should be relativly easy once I finish theatre 1, Adding Seats and stuff.  After that, I'll be adding some eye candy . . . Standees, Posters, etc..  So I figure it'll take me a little over a month from now, wyhich is why the date has been pushed back to 12/21/01  Just in time for 1/5/02.  Yeah!
