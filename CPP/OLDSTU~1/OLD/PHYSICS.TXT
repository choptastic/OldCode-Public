				       Disturbing the Universe

	Cosmologists will accept that most of the universe is not made

of the same atoms that are on earth.  They even give them cool names 

like WIMPs and axions.  They discuss wormholes that connect the 

universe and black holes which gravity is so strong that even light

cannot escape.  They have just about reached thier limit on exploration

and understanding.  A new bizzare force has been discovered and they 

begun trying to understand it.  They discovered, using the methods they

use, that the universe is expanding faster than it was.  This is quit 

odd, because according to gravity, everything is attracted to 

everything else.  This new force seems to have emerged from space-time 

itself and is stretching the universe like a god playing with silly 

putty.  If this is so, why is the universe expanding FASTER?  This new 

force is the complete opposite of Gravity, Anti-Gravity.  It's like 

this, Gravity is Matter that is attractive and Anti-gravity is SPACE 

that is repulsive.  Back when we didn't know that the Universe was 

expanding, Einstein "made up" the idea of a counter-gravitational 

force to make up for gravity in the belief that if Gravity attracts,

there must be a force that keeps the universe static.  He called this

made up force the cosmological constant.  Even though we now know the

universe is expanding, this "Cosmological Constant" seems to have been 

popping up more and more over the last few years.  This "Made up" 

force may in actuality, exist.  It is still unknown as to the 

factuality of Anti-Gravity, but Cosmoligists will continue research on 

this new phenonena and if it is truely existant, the Universe will not 

end in a Ball of Fire as thought, but in an icy, empty, abyss where 

everything in the universe is too far from everything else.
