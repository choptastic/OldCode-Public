<CENTER>Well, where should I start?</CENTER>

<CENTER>A voice from afar : The Beginning!!!</CENTER>

<CENTER>Good idea.</CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Chapter 1: The Beginning</FONT></CENTER>
Many Moons ago, I, Chops, downloaded Quake from my friends Warez FTP site.&nbsp;
That friend was MrBeetle, who had previously owned his own clan (Knights
of Doom).&nbsp; He was very good, from what I knew but his clan eventually
fell apart.&nbsp; Can't win everything can ya?&nbsp; So I downloaded it
and he informed me of Quakespy and that is how u play on the internet.&nbsp;
Sounded good.&nbsp; I'm no idiot, so I know that if there's something popular
on the net, I search for it, instead of always asking where to get it.&nbsp;
I got it and played Quake.&nbsp; This is the beginning . . .
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Chapter 2: Deathgate</FONT></CENTER>
So I played and played and played.&nbsp; I was pretty horrible, but it
didn't matter.&nbsp; It was fun and that's what games are all about, fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Without knowing it, I started going to the same server, Deathgate, a MOD
server run by SNC (StarNet Clan).&nbsp; I played on Deathgate all the time
with the cool MODs.&nbsp; I loved the grappling hook and the bouncing betties.&nbsp;
Ohhh.. how I miss betties.&nbsp; I played and played and played, getting
better and better.&nbsp; Then another thing happened, I noticed a buncha
players that alwys played and they were all the same color combinations
and wore the same skins.&nbsp; Plus they all Had (DVC) or ~Hate inc~&nbsp;
before or after thier names.&nbsp; hmm......&nbsp; what was this?!?&nbsp;
I eventually learned form a guy that said "Clans Suck" and the DVC people
responded "Screw you" and such, that that was called a clan.&nbsp; I would
actually get nervous playing them, because they were really good.&nbsp;
I continued to keep to myself and really only say "Bye" and "Hello all"
when I left and joined a game.&nbsp; I always hoped that DVC or Hate inc
would notice something in me and ask me to join thier respective clan.&nbsp;
That never happened (well i've been asked before, but until after PiaS
was started).&nbsp; I also noticed the best of the players I'd played with
and I'll name them so they feel cool.&nbsp; They were Predator~Hate inc~
and (DVC)-Lord of Radix.&nbsp; I saw those as the best players in the world
(that was also before I knew of Thresh).&nbsp;&nbsp; I started futzin with
skins and stuff, making a Chops skin. and having fun on my own.&nbsp; Then,
I got the idea, hey, I'm horrible and no one will let me join thier clan,
so I'll make my own.&nbsp; Woohoo!!!!&nbsp; Chops, you genius.&nbsp; So
I got some of my friends together who were also hooked on Quake, like myself,
and we started the mighty Poop in a Shoe clan.&nbsp; I made skins that
were horrible but easily deciferable betweens clans and members. All of
us, being the horrible Quake players we are started a Clan, and I was the
leader, because it was my idea and I was the best Quake of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then one glorious day, (DVC)-NosferatU said something to me, he said "Hey
Chops, Tell everyone to go to Deathzone."&nbsp; So I did.&nbsp; This was
the beginning of my Quake Friends.
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Chapter 3: Why I Called it Poop in a Shoe</FONT></CENTER>
That's not a very tough question, but it has a long explanation.&nbsp;
I wanted to make a clan for those like myself that were not good enough
for any GOOD clans, so I made this.&nbsp; Poop in a Shoe was a phrase ex-PiaS
legend, dedsapper, said for as long as I knew him.&nbsp; The Phrase was
perfect for the description of the Clan.&nbsp; The abbreviation itself
was cool, PiaS.&nbsp; People still laugh at the thought of the mighty Poop
in a Shoe.
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Chapter 4: DVC</FONT></CENTER>
As you know, there were two clans that stuck out amongst the crowd.&nbsp;
These were the clans I still to this day an in contact with and will even
be meeting some of them in person.&nbsp; One of those Clans was DVC.&nbsp;
After NosferatU addressed me, I felt I was cool enough and welcome enough
to talk to some DVC members.&nbsp; I talked with Nos(feratU) a little and
I found that he was one of the Three Leaders of DVC.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also
got to learning that DVC stands for Deadly Venom Clan.&nbsp; Then one time
I was playing and (DVC)-TreeTrunK was also and everyone left.&nbsp; So
I was just running around shooting him and he was running around killing
me and I got to chattin with him.&nbsp; As it turned out, he was Nos's
Brother and one of the other Leaders.&nbsp; I asked him questions about
DVC, about history as stuff and then I asked him how one might join DVC.&nbsp;
I told him I had no intention of actually joining because, well I',m he
leader of a clan, but I asked for a FAKE tryout.&nbsp; How you tryout is
you play TreeTrunK 1on1 up to 15.&nbsp; If you win you are in, otherwise
you must show some screenshots of you winning levels.&nbsp; Alot of them.&nbsp;
I played him the next morning at noon and (DVC)-Lord of Radix was there!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;
The guy that I thought was the quake god!!&nbsp; He was there!!!&nbsp;
That was really cool.&nbsp; We played on DVC's Snakepit server, which is
no longer around, but a legend nonetheless.&nbsp; He stomped me 15 to -4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I laughed, he laghed, Radix laughed.&nbsp; It was obvious I was pretty
horrible.&nbsp; I talked with Tree and Radix and Nos (because he's Tree's
bro).&nbsp; I got to learn more about DVC and that the other clan I thought
was awesome, Hate inc, was thier ally.&nbsp; More DVCers joined Snakepit
and we all just played and had a good ol' time, quakin and such.&nbsp;
For the next month or so, I hung out with DVC most of the time on Quake.
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Chapter 5: Hate inc</FONT></CENTER>
After I had been hanging out with DVC for some time, I started getting
to know Hate inc through teh DVC-Hate inc alliance, which eventually dissolved
due to tension between the clans.&nbsp; I protested teh breakup because
I was like best internet buds with DVC and hate alike, but I'm not even
in that clan, so my imput really isn't that important.&nbsp; So I hung
out on Clan Hate inc's Congo Control server getting to know hate inc and
making budds with everyone.&nbsp; WE played RA together and some TF, but
nothing really that much.&nbsp; We were buds and it was cool.&nbsp; One
member, who is one of my best Quake buds, Deathpool (now renamed to Burn),
was one of the coolest guys or both clans.&nbsp; He was really good, but
wan't arrogant about it (not that I'm implying the other clans are arrogant).&nbsp;
After he joined Hate, he had conflicts with the leaders Monk and Misfit,
so he quit hate, then he joined DVC, then he had conflicts with Nos and
Tree, and hge rejoined Hate.&nbsp; I continuiously got better playing quake
with both clan DVC and clan Hate.
